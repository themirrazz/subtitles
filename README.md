# themirrazz' fansubs
Welcome to my fansubs repository! Here you can find all of the fansubs I've created. All of these are softsubs; you will not find a single hardsubs in this repository. Before downloading or using any of my fansubs, please go over the [license](LICENSE.md) file.

## What are fansubs?
**Fan-made subtitles**, or *fan-subs* for short, are unofficial subtitles for a movie or TV show created by fans (in this case, mostly anime). Often, fansubs will preserve cultural naunces that official subtitles sometimes don't preserve. For example, the sentences "ヒナタくん" (hinatakun) and "お兄ちゃん" (onīchan) might be translated as "Mr. Hinata" (or just "Hinata") and "big bro" by the official subtitles, fansubs might leave them as "Hinata-kun" and "onii-chan."

## How to watch my fansubs
### Streaming online
> [!TIP]
> On Netflix, Substital may move the video to the very top of the screen; this bug can simply be fixed by zooming all the way out (Ctrl+Equals or Cmd+Equals) and then resetting the zoom to normal (Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Substital only supports .SRT files. If the fansubs does not include a .SRT version, it won't work with Substital.

#### Step 1. Install Substital
