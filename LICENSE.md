# Terms Of Use
My fansubs are provided for free; the media they are made for is not. By downloading or using any of my fansubs, you agree to these following terms.

## 1. Do not use with pirated media
You are only allowed to use fansubs with official releases. In addition, to support your local distributors, please try buying the media inside of your country before resorting to importing it from outside. In addition, do not upload it to piracy or darkweb websites, as doing so encourages piracy of the media.

## 2. Do not create hardsubs (or packages)
You are not allowed to use my fansubs, which come in the format of softsubs, to create hardsubs. Hardsubbing is when the subtitles are burned into the video, and therefore also distribute the media content (piracy). This extends to any form of packaging the media content with the subtitles. An example of this is offering my subtitles along with a video file together inside of a ZIP archive. If you have permission from both me and the company who owns the original media, you may create hardsubs and/or packages.

## 3. Include these terms and credit
You may distribute my fansubs online or via physical media, as long as you either include these terms, or include a link back to them, and credit me, and as long as you do it in a way that follows the rest of these terms.

## 4. Do not monetize
Please do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise exchange my fansubs for money. However, using parts of the subtitle files for certain things (eg a monetized reaction video) is allowed, depending on how much you use, the context in which it is used, whether you are also using the original media, etc.

## 5. Do not harm the producers (or distributors)
Please do not use these subtitles in a way that harms the producers or distributors. In the end, doing so only hurts you, the consumer, because companies are not made out of money. If they can't make money off of their products, then soon, they can't make products to even make money off of. Protect the TV industry. Don't be stupid.
