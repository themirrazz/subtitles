1
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,751
Let's go!

2
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,003
Ready, go!

3
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,715
No issues found with the engine.

4
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,799
Copy that.

5
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,259
No issues found with the fuel system.

6
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,218
Copy that.

7
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,763
You're Lieutenant Shikishima, right?

8
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,386
I'm Tachibana, from the Tsukuba Naval

9
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:47,899
Air Group's maintenance squadron.

9
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,067
Do you remember me?

10
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,485
Tachibana-san.

11
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,867
Of course!

11
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:53,113
Thank you for your help during that time.

12
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,031
Yes.

12
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,650
Wow...

13
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:59,400
You managed to land that low-quality aircraft

14
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,663
on this hole-filled runway.

14
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,207
As usual, your skills appear to be reliable.

15
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,586
Even though my results in mock ariel combat are good,

16
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,047
going into a real battle with no experience is different.

17
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,723
Luckily, a malfunction in the aircraft

18
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:15,552
gave you some extra time.

18
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,681
Actually...

19
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,368
No matter how hard I try,

19
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:24,311
I can't find the error you're talking about.

20
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,650
What are you saying?

21
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,298
Isn't it a good thing?

21
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,267
That we have people like you?

22
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,521
Even if you obey an order like "go die,"

23
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,190
the outcome of this war is already clear.

24
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,591
Give me a gun!

24
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:07,496
Yes, yes!

25
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:09,916
An enemy attack?

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,899
I'm not sure.

26
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,585
What is it?

27
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,587
Something big!

28
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,172
Is it a new weapon for the US military?

29
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,220
Taki!

30
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,495
Taki! 

31
00:04:23:340 --> 00:04:24,139
It's on the coast!

32
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:25,510
Copy that!

33
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,422
Taki!

33
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:39,988
Taki-san!

34
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,698
What is this thing?

35
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,282
It's Godzilla...

36
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:44,201
It's what?

36
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,994
That's what the guy on the island said.

37
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,000
He said that on days like today when

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,437
deep-sea fish float,

37
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:48,955
Godzilla will come.

38
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,957
Godzilla?

39
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,632
It's no good.

40
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,800
Let's get out of here!

41
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,717
Run!

42
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,344
Run!

43
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,388
Hey, hurry up!

44
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,936
Hurry! Run, quickly!

45
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,106
What is that thing?

46
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,608
We're not sure either.

47
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,486
Lieutenant Shikishima!

48
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,403
What is it?

49
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,657
Can you go over there and shoot it with a 20mm?

50
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,076
You're the only person who can shoot it.

51
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,994
We're all just from maintenance squadron.

52
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,498
But wouldn't it be bad if it only gets injured?

53
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,376
No living being can survive being hit by a 20mm!

54
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,134
Hurry up!

54
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:37,212
Before it gets within attack range!

55
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,548
Hurry, hurry!

56
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,341
Go!

57
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,343
Hurry!

58
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:57,983
Go!

59
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,124
What is he doing?

60
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,216
Now! Shoot!

61
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,107
It's coming this way!

62
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,192
What should we do, Tachibana-san?

63
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,240
Ammo!

63
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,570
Get some bullets!

64
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,300
Idiot!

64
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:52,287
Don't shoot it!

65
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,259
Stop, you idiot!

66
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:56,082
Stop!

67
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:01,839
Get out!

68
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:02,746
Get out!

68
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,798
Get out!

68
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,133
Hurry and get out!

69
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,765
Tachibana-san!

70
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,898
Shoot!

72
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,000
Tomita!

75
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,514
I'll draw it to the front!

76
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,473
Shoot to kill!

77
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,133
How could something like this happen to you...

78
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,270
Hey!

79
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,149
Hey!

80
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,781
Everyone is dead!

81
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,534
They're dead!

81
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,158
Hey!

82
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:42,126
It's because you didn't shoot it!

83
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,378
Damn you!

84
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,001
Hey!

85
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,003
Hey!

86
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,775
Move.

87
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,380
Isn't that loose?

88
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,298
Yes.

89
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,674
Pay attention carefully.

90
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,259
It's going to be a pain if things keep dragging on.

91
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,594
Yes.

92
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,312
Kōichi-san, is that you?

93
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,317
Ōta-neesan!

94
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,569
Didn't you go on a suicide attack?

95
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,488
Eh? Is that not the case?

96
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,707
And you came back with a calm face?

97
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,335
Shame on you!

98
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,478
It's because all the soldiers are cowards

99
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:56,049
that things are the way they are!

99
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,386
If you guys had stayed strong...

100
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,182
...my children wouldn't have died.

101
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,653
Do you know what happened to my parents?

102
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,954
Everyone died.

103
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:32,043
This area was surrounded by fire.

104
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,006
Your parents too...

105
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,971
Same fate as my children.

106
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,740
"Come back alive."

107
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,912
That's what you said, right?

108
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,014
You thief!

109
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,461
Move!

109
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:29,523
Move, move!

110
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,392
Get her!

111
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:32,200
Move! Move!

111
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,063
Huh?

112
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:35,611
Please!

112
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:36,566
Eh?

113
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,352
Stop!

113
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:38,401
Stop right there!

114
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,569
Stop right there!

116
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,032
Eh...

117
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,020
Onii-san!

118
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,984
Finally.

119
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,820
Onii-san, it's your fault.

120
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:23,975
I can't come pick up the baby

120
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:25,782
when you're hanging in an area like that.

121
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,618
Have you been here watching this entire time?

122
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:34,207
I was getting impatient waiting for you to move, okay?

123
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,169
You're hungry, aren't you?

124
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,340
Why didn't you just leave this kid behind?

125
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,509
Hey!

126
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,639
There's no way I could leave her behind in that place!

127
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,017
Eh?

128
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,354
Eh...

129
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,651
Please don't follow me.

130
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,477
If you leave us here like this,

130
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:04,821
both me and the child will die.

131
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,280
I don't know you!

132
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,705
Once you're done, you're going home.

133
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,547
Scary, isn't he?

133
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:18,501
Onii-san is heartless.

134
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,173
What happened to your husband?

135
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,008
Was he taken into the army?

136
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,720
Do I look like I have a husband?

137
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:30,628
Eh?

137
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,974
Then whose kid is that?

138
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,487
It doesn't matter.

138
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:37,562
That's not a good thing!

139
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,443
During the air raids...

140
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,946
...the child's dying okaa-san asked me to.

141
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:49,991
So then...

142
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,494
You're not related to that child?

143
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:55,788
So what?

144
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,501
What are you, an idiot?

145
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,590
You're not in a place to take in a baby like that

145
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,464
and live peacefully!

146
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,299
Even you couldn't abandon it, onii-san.

147
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,508
Hey!

148
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,724
Name?

150
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:23,316
Your name.

151
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:26,736
Noriko.

152
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,033
Why do you act like that?

153
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,322
If you're acting like you're a vagrant,

153
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:34,577
it means you're probably poor.

154
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,829
Are you telling me to become a whore?

155
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,623
Don't give me that look.

156
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,674
In this day and age,

156
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:42,898
if you're out of options,

156
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:43,753
then it can't be helped.

157
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,052
What about your parents and siblings?

158
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,688
Your parents?

159
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,069
Yeah.

160
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,740
They both died in the air raid.

161
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,455
You and me are the same, onii-san.

162
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,684
Eh?

163
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,200
He... 

163
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:41,100
Hey!

163
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:41,811
Wait a...

164
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,273
You...

165
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,329
Hey!

166
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,250
What's with that?

167
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:06,919
With what?

168
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,754
Don't play dumb.

169
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,674
The parent and the child you picked up.

170
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,718
Who do you think you are,

170
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,844
picking up people like that?

171
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,698
No.

172
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,848
They just showed up and settled on their own.

172
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,781
If you haven't kicked them out,

172
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:22,476
then you've picked them up.

173
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,816
Hypocrite...

174
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,130
I'm not dealing with this.

174
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:34,739
Sorry for wasting your time.

175
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,661
Ah...

175
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,218
That kid...

176
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,124
Is she breastfeeding it properly?

177
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:47,648
Ah, no...

178
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,153
She's...

179
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,589
She's not the child's mother.

179
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,175
What is that supposed to mean?

180
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,980
If things continue like this,

181
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,649
she'll die of malnutrition.

181
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,359
Right?

183
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,784
Picking up a child you're not capable of raising...

184
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,283
What on earth is that all about?

185
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,535
I'm sorry.

186
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,796
It's not for you to eat.

187
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,341
Adults can survive no matter what they eat.

188
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,973
Use this to make gruel for the child.

189
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,132
Ah...

189
00:19:46:200 --> 00:19:48,312
There goes my white rice.

190
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,649
It's annoying, seriously...

192
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,287
Ah, damn it!

193
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,872
I'm soaking wet!

195
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,256
Did you get a job?

196
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,260
I did find something, but...

197
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,178
Eh? What's the problem?

198
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,096
Ah...

199
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,724
The pay isn't bad either.

200
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,308
Check this out..

201
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,132
It seems that just the preperation money

201
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:29,311
is ¥3000 alone!

202
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,272
That's awesome!

203
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,111
It has to be a scam.

204
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:38,375
Just the other day,

204
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,406
all the rice that you brought in was stolen.

205
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,284
That's not the case with this.

206
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,494
What's different about it?

207
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,920
It has a stamp of approval from none other

208
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,205
than the Ministry of Demobilization.

208
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,000
There's a reason that it pays so well.

209
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,418
The reason?

210
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,695
During the war,

210
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,984
both the US military and Imperial Navy

211
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:58,466
secretly laid down mines, right?

211
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,634
It's a job to clean that up.

212
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,346
But the pay is insanely good, because...

213
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,098
Well...

214
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:09,732
There's...

214
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,105
There's no guarantee that I'll come back alive.

215
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,525
What are you talking about?!

216
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,402
You just made it back alive!

217
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,289
There's nothinng else we can do!

218
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,324
At this rate,

218
00:21:21,324 --> 00:21:22,907
the three of us are going to starve to death!

219
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,450
Even Akiko if it keeps going like this...

220
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,205
I understand that, but...

221
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,000
If we have the money...

222
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,905
If we have the money,

222
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:37,713
we can even buy powdered milk from America!

223
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,672
For that reason, I'd...

224
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,342
It's no good if you die!

225
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,931
It's okay.

226
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,442
Just becaus it's dangerous 

226
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,018
doesn't mean I'm going to die.

227
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,740
It's different from the suicide attacks

228
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,730
of ten deaths and no lives.

228
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,300
And besides,

229
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:02,400
I'll be on a special ship,

229
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,865
so the magnetic mines won't be able to detect us.

229
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,700
This is...

230
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:12,540
The special ship?

230
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:27,804
Hey, you!

231
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,640
Are you our next gunner?

231
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,641
I'm Shikishima.

232
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,559
Are you a boat gunner?

233
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,893
I used to be a fighter pilot.

234
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:33,700
What?

235
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:35,354
What's this guy for?

235
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,856
You're a former fighter pilot?

236
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,104
I don't want to be with this

237
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:39,900
wreck of a military shōnen.

237
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,573
Were you disappointed?

238
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,404
That this is what the ship is like?

239
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,869
The US military and Japan's Imperial Navy laid down

240
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:49,368
around 60,000 mines along the coast.

240
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,200
Well, there are many different types, 

241
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52:770
but the most difficult ones

241
00:22:52:770 --> 00:22:54,081
are the US's magnetic mines.

241
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56:760
If a ship made out of metal passed by, 

241
00:22:56:760 --> 00:22:58,502
it would react and detonate.

242
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,900
So that's why...

243
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,050
He catches on quickly.

244
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,053
Our main job is to clean up moored mines.

245
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,629
To counter magnetic mines,

245
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:11,599
this wooden boat is the best solution.

246
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,477
I'm Noda.

247
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,850
I developed weapons at the Navy Arsenal

248
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,107
during the war.

248
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,735
This is Captain Akitsu and Mizushima-kun.

249
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,361
This one's "The Kid" and that one's "The Academic



250
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,385
How do you feel about

251
00:23:25,385 --> 00:23:26,739
addressing me like that, chou-san?

251
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,657
And I'm not a kid anymore!

252
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,272
You're still only a beginner,

253
00:23:30,272 --> 00:23:31,160
so being called a kid is more than enough.

253
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:31,940
Yeah, yeah. 

253
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,538
I haven't gone to war anyway.

254
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,957
This is the special minesweeper Shinseimaru.

255
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,001
Paired up with the Kaishinmaru right next to it.

256
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:44,089
Mines are like balloons that rise from the ocean floor.

257
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46:607
We attached cutters to the cables between the

258
00:23:46:607 --> 00:23:50,596
two ships to cut the mines' wires.

258
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,140
That will cause the mines to float to the surface.

259
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,351
So that using this...

260
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,145
it goes DADADADADA!

261
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,105
Watch us.

262
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,410
This one's quite difficult to hit.

263
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,496
Can I do it?

264
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,539
Are you sure?

265
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,004
Because it's shaking...

266
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,770
You have to predict where the bullet will land

267
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,133
before you fire.

268
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,019
Good job!

269
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,313
It's the same as shooting down an enemy plane.

270
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,899
Except, well, I was never in an actual battle.

271
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:44,984
Eh?

272
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,653
You have no experience in practical combat?

273
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,280
That means Shikishima and I are pretty much the same.

274
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:50,889
Idiot.

275
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:51,281
You're completely different.

275
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,992
You can't fly a plane, can you?

276
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,357
If I had gone to war,

277
00:24:54,357 --> 00:24:55,995
I would've been a great help.

277
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,956
Ah, if only it lasted a little bit longer...

278
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,752
Are you seriously saying that?

279
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:08,173
I'm sorry.

280
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,637
Idiot.

281
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,664
Ah! Stop it!

282
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,667
Shoot it!

283
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,140
Run away!

284
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,754
Evacuate, evacuate!

285
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,272
Are you okay?

286
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,239
A bad dream again?

287
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,165
Dr... dream.

288
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,212
I see...

289
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,882
It's a dream...

290
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,140
Unless...

291
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:42,527
...you're...

292
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,894
...the dream.

292
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,913
What are you talking about?

292
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:46,188
Are you okay?

293
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,710
This is Japan, right?

294
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,100
Right?

294
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,360
I'm actually back, right?

295
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,361
Right?

296
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,320
I came back, didn't I?

297
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,446
Stop it!

298
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,593
I understand...

299
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,470
I know.

300
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,723
I know.

301
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,807
Nice place you built here.

302
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:32,878
It's worth all of the money you saved up.

302
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,176
Please help yourself.

303
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:41,678
This is, this is...

304
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,974
May I take one?

305
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,397
Eh?

306
00:28:47,397 --> 00:28:47,935
That's...

306
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,269
That would be a waste of film!

307
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,021
Ah, that smile!

308
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,981
Just like that, just like that...

309
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:54,524
Yes!

310
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:57,736
Thank you.

311
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,970
Hey, Academic.

312
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,072
Don't go falling for Nori-chan!

312
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,196
What are you talking about?

312
00:29:02,196 --> 00:29:04,576
Noriko-san is a married woman!

313
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,380
Please stop!

314
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,996
I'm not his wife!

314
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,626
What does that mean?

315
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,337
She settled down here without my permission.

316
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,840
There was nowhere else for her to go,

317
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,424
So I just let her stay here.

317
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,343
Then whose kid is this?

318
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,311
It's her stepchild,

319
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:25,222
though they aren't blood-related.

319
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,226
She's an orphan that was

320
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:28,850
entrusted to her during the air raids.

320
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,143
Eh?

321
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,771
Isn't that a touching story in this day and age?

322
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,110
No.

323
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,941
I'm just not thinking ahead.

323
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,945
Otō-chan.

324
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:42,786
Akiko.

325
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44:350
Yes?

325
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:45,891
I told you.

326
00:29:46,261 --> 00:29:47,744
I'm not your tō-chan.

326
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,319
Shikishima.

327
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:53,375
Isn't it a bad idea to say that?

327
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,835
It's really unhealthy.

328
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:56,658
Hey.

328
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,419
Both of you were brought into a family

329
00:29:58,419 --> 00:29:59,523
by fate, and so...

329
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,883
You need to be prepared for that.

329
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,344
Make them happy!

330
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,680
Shut up!

331
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,433
I'm not interested in that kind of thing.

332
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,273
Why?

333
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,700
Welcome back.

333
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,666
I also just returned myself.

334
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,585
What's with your appearance?

335
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,381
How does it look?

336
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,217
I started working as an office worker in Ginza.

338
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,471
I've given you enough money though, right?

339
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,396
I've decided I finally want to be independent.

340
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,160
At this rate, Kou-san,

340
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,151
you'll never find a wife.

341
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,239
Did you know?

342
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,492
Ginza's also recovering very quickly.

343
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,660
Isn't this a bit soon?

344
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,288
I've been thinking about this for a while now.

345
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,208
What about Akiko?

346
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:23,382
What will Akiko do while you're at work, Noriko-san?

347
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,218
Sumiko-san will take care of her when I'm at work.

349
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,971
Sumiko-san is very enthusiastic about it.

350
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,766
She said, "I've raised 3 children myself."

351
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,493
Well if that's the case,

352
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:38,438
it's fine then.

352
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,000
Well then,

353
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,651
I'm gonna go get Akiko.

353
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,132
It is estimated that these large sea creatures

354
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:30,439
will reach the Kantō region of Japan

354
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:32,200
within a few weeks at latest.

354
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,128
Supreme Commander Douglas McAurthur has

355
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:38,503
regrettably announced that due to the situation

355
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:39,925
with the Soviet Union,

355
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:43,670
military involvement is not possible.

355
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:44,700
At the same time,

355
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,780
they requested Japan to strengthen all of

355
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,302
it's security agencies.

356
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,900
This...

357
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,986
Was it a giant shark?

358
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,322
A whale?

359
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,492
Sharks and whales can't do this type of damage.

360
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,036
A new Soviet weapon?

361
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,079
Does that look like weapon damage to you?

362
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,623
Then what are you saying?

363
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,417
Something big, like a mountain.

364
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,627
Like what?

365
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,321
You're just acting arrogant even though

366
00:33:25,321 --> 00:33:26,171
you don't understand any of it either.

366
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,299
I was being skeptical until I saw this.

367
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:32,731
Godzilla.

368
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:36,681
Please look at that!

369
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,058
Ah?

370
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,121
On the day Godzilla came to the island,

371
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,523
deep-sea fish were floating to the top.

371
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,192
You saw that thing?

372
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,140
It was a monster that looked like

373
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,530
a dinosaur that had survived.

373
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,909
The locals call him Godzilla.

374
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:57,452
Godzilla?

375
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:58,576
Foolishness.

376
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:00,288
Does that type of thing even exist?

376
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,623
You were half-asleep and probably saw an enemy tank-

377
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,700
You probably won't believe me,

378
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,470
but that Godzilla wiped out

378
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,505
the entire garrison on Ōdo Island!

378
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,507
Wait a second...

379
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,343
I thought unit that got wiped out by the US military?

380
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,170
Ōdo Island was ignored by America

381
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,182
during Operation Jumping Stone.

381
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,440
During that time,

382
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,431
it was an emergency landing site

382
00:34:21,431 --> 00:34:23,228
for malfunctioning suicide attack planes.

382
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,605
So then, Shikishima...

383
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,441
Are you a former suicide attack pilot?

384
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:37,409
If this is the same Godzilla as the one from the island,

385
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,871
it will have grown bigger and more powerful.

386
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,337
Please give me a moment...

387
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:53,383
Why were we called out here in the first place?

388
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,712
There's no way we're...

389
00:34:55,712 --> 00:34:57,554
gonna have to fight that type of thing, right?

389
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,471
On this type of ship?

390
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,223
That's the case.

391
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:00,526
Eh?

392
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,602
That type of thing's impossible!

392
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:04,951
What are we supposed to do with

393
00:35:04,951 --> 00:35:06,800
this kind of petty ship against something

393
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,398
the US military can't even take down?

393
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,442
They told us to stall it.

394
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,944
Stall?

395
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,739
The Takao is coming from Singapore.

396
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,501
Heavy Crusier Takao?

397
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:18,450
That one?

397
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,418
It was awaiting scuttling,

398
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,953
but it seems that they decided to bring it back.

398
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,300
Isn't that awesome!

399
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,415
The Takao!

399
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:29,210
I was ordered to buy time until the Takao arrives.

400
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,570
This ship is from America-san, right?

401
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,485
Can't they deal with it themselves?

401
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,500
Things are getting weirder between America

402
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,843
and the Soviet Union right now.

402
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,388
They can't carelessly take military action.

403
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,683
They prefer we handle these types of trivial matters.

404
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:44,976
Is this a trival matter?

405
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,562
The only weapons we have is a 13mm gun.

406
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:51,191
They said we could use recovered mines for that purpose.

407
00:35:53,722 --> 00:35:56,112
So that's why they called us out here.

408
00:35:56,196 --> 00:36:00,450
The most important weapons are "locally sourced."

409
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,335
And regarding this,

409
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:04,621
you are not allowed to tell anyone about it.

410
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,360
There it is.

411
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,916
The usual gag order.

411
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,294
This country never changes!

412
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,047
Can it even change?

413
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,849
Let's swap places.

414
00:36:27,536 --> 00:36:28,687
Thank you.

415
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,564
You're too stuck in your seat, Shiki-san.

416
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,235
To think that the other opponent could be Godzilla...

417
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,613
I know how you feel.

418
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,425
When I think back to the war,

419
00:36:43,425 --> 00:36:45,787
sometimes I also have trouble sleeping.

419
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,123
I want to defeat the enemy.

420
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,769
But at the same time,

421
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,545
I find it incredibly frightening.

421
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,129
There are only two of those,

422
00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:03,555
including a spare.

422
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:10,937
What's wrong?

423
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,725
The amount of fish on Ōdo Island is nothing

424
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:33,585
compared to what's happening right now...

424
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,400
Stay on gaurd!

425
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:39,007
Stay on gaurd!

425
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,134
Godzilla is coming!

426
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,761
Stay on gaurd!

427
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,556
Here he comes!

428
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,201
Kid, keep your mines ready

429
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,000 
to drop at any time!

429
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,350
Yes!

430
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,478
Shikishima, prepare the machine guns.

430
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,394
Let's run away!

431
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:54,189
We can't fight it on a ship like this!

431
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,315
There's still time!

432
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,775
Let's see how that works out, chou-san!

433
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,240
Academic, keep your eyes peeled and

434
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,735
report back to me.

434
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,652
Chou-san!

435
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,529
Shinseimaru to Kaishinmaru!

436
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,170
It looks like he's about to show up.

437
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:04,991
Get ready.

437
00:38:05,273 --> 00:38:08,286
We're taking all the credit for defeating the monster.

438
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,135
Those bastards!

439
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:09,579
Captain!

439
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,852
If we run away now,

440
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:12,860
the Takao won't make it in time,

440
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,168
so where will the monster head for?

440
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:19,047
I don't want to see Tōkyō engulfed in flames again.

441
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,549
But this ship is no match for it.

442
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,219
Chou-san, I thought you hated government orders!

443
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,596
Ah, I do hate them!

444
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,722
However...

445
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,558
Someone has to draw the short straw.

446
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,078
This is just impossible.

447
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:55,625
Academic, engine!

448
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,126
Working on it now!

449
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,878
Shikishima!

450
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,339
Shikishima!

451
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,350
Hurry up!

452
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,175
Hurry over here!

452
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,886
Captain!

453
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,346
Got it!

454
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,430
Increase the throttle!

455
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,348
All right!

456
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,892
Drop the mines!

457
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,380
He's almost here!

458
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,082
It's too late!

458
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,209
Even so, we still have to do something!

459
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,188
Now, kid!

460
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,690
Here it goes!

462
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,072
Did it do it?

463
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,496
It's not working!

464
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:16,512
Oh crap,

465
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:16,993
Oh crap,

465
00:40:16,993 --> 00:40:16,512
Oh crap,

465
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:17,400
Oh crap,

465
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,774
Oh crap,

465
00:40:17,774 --> 00:40:18,166
Oh crap!

465
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,545
Shikishima!

466
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:20,001
Machine gun!

466
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,210
Yes!

467
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,219
Shikishima!

468
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:41,960
No good!

479
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,274
It's useless!

470
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,850
Inside it's mouth!

471
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,448
How about inside it's mouth?

471
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,077
Reel it in, reel it in!

472
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,663
Reel, reel, reel, reel!

473
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,830
Drop it!

474
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,640
Mizushima!

475
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,590
Ignition!

475
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:08,508
Yes!

476
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,386
Eh?

477
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,601
Eh?

478
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:19,894
No way...

479
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:21,562
No way!

480
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,035
Get down!

481
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,601
Did we kill it?

482
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:09,610
No!

486
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,596
The Takao!

487
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,722
Just in time.

488
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:07,251
Crap...

489
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,774
Can you shoot it again?

490
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,290
Did they do it?

491
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,219
What's that?

493
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,740
Have you finally woken up?

494
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:03,993
Where am I?

495
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,412
This is the Yokosuka Hospital.

496
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,164
You were sent here directly after what happened.

497
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,710
What about the people abord the Takao and Kaishinmaru?

498
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,092
Godzilla...

499
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,971
I see. Where did it go?

500
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,641
It's whereabouts are unknown.

501
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,768
Godzilla was heading towards Tōkyō.

502
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,100
If we don't hurry and issue the evacuation orders,

503
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:30,937
something bad will happen.

503
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,600
The government will be hiding this

504
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,565
information from the public.

504
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,984
Why aren't they telling everyone now?

505
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,737
Likely due to the fear of causing confusion.

506
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,948
Now isn't the time to say things like that!

507
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,783
If we don't evacuate now, then...

508
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:47,420
Nobody wants to be held responsible for the chaos

509
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,663
that will inevitably be caused.

509
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,582
Information control is this country's specialty.

510
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,635
What on earth happened?

511
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,889
Noriko-san, it has nothing to do with you.

512
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,519
What's bothering you so much, Kou-san?

513
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,510
With your help,

514
00:46:16,510 -->00:46:18,025
we've been living together to this day.

514
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:22,530
And yet I have no part of your life whatsoever?

515
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,620
If you're carrying a burden,

516
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,710
I'd like you to share it with me.

516
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,764
I'm...

517
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,143
I'm...

518
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,738
...one of the suicide attackers...

519
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,827
...who ran away.

520
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,455
Eh?

521
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,690
On the day of the attack,

522
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,906
I pretended my plane malfunctioned...

522
00:47:22,102 --> 00:47:23,560
...and landed...

522
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,886
...at a landing site on Ōdo Island.

523
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,067
These...

524
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,655
belonged to the maintenance crew there.

525
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,286
All of them died.

526
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,700
On that night,

527
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,681
a giant dinosaur-like monster appeared.

527
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:19,720
They asked me to shoot it down

528
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,507
with the machine gun from a Fighter Zero.

528
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:25,528
But I...

529
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,868
I ran away again.

530
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:38,500
As a result,

531
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,709
all of them were killed by the monster.

531
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,212
They all have should been able to see their families!

532
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:54,056
The monster was called "Godzilla."

533
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,730
And it appeared again.

534
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:05,985
But...

535
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,739
Once again, I couldn't do anything.

536
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,941
I'm really a person...

537
00:49:23,945 --> 00:49:26,005
who doesn't deserve to be alive.

537
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,013
Kou-san...

538
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:40,853
Survivors are supposed to live proper lives.

539
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,813
What do you understand, Noriko-san?!

540
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:43,981
I understand!

541
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,300
My parents said "Live!" to me

542
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,777
as they were being burned in the fire.

542
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,168
Because of that,

543
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:53,699
I can't die, no matter what!

543
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,577
That's what I've been feeling.

544
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,674
It's impossible.

545
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,329
Those guys...

545
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,994
Every night, every night,

546
00:50:15,994 --> 00:50:17,431
I dream about them!


546
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,850
"Come up here quickly," they say.

547
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,104
"How do you live your life so proudly?"

548
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,470
Those are dreams.

549
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,484
Illusions created by you, Kou-san.

549
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29:000
First of all...

550
00:50:29:400 --> 00:50:30,027
First of all...

550
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:34,156
Am I even alive?

551
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,619
I died on that island a long time ago...

552
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,454
Decaying...

553
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:47,795
Noriko-san and Akiko are looking at the corpse...

554
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,339
That's definently it!

555
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,132
You are alive!

556
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,556
Kou-san is alive!

557
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:03,852
Don't you understand?

558
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,828
Yes, hold the spoon.

559
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,456
Yes, gently, gently.

560
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,166
Wait, wait...

562
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,004
Yes, now stir the miso soup.

563
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,005
Yep.

564
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,840
Good, good.

565
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,426
Yes, we did it!

566
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,343
Yep!

567
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,180
Raddish. Akiko's favorite raddish.

568
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,181
Raddish.

569
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,474
Please give it a taste.

570
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,392
Yes.

571
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,810
Yes, please.

572
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,647
Drink the soup...

573
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:49,732
Yes, the raddish.

574
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,484
Delicious.

575
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,528
Hot? Is it hot?

576
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,696
Yep!

577
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,741
Hey, aren't the raddishes delicious?

578
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,951
Yep, delicious!

579
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,537
Hey...

580
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,708
Is it okay if we end this?

581
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,842
I'd like to live again.

582
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,530
Is this an example of...

583
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,617
Hurry up and report it!

584
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,619
Hurry!

585
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,120
Yes!

586
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,952
A costal defense ship from offshore partrol

586
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:10,979
reported a giant creature heading towards Tōkyō bay.

587
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,898
So, it'll be here soon, won't it?

588
00:53:15,324 --> 00:53:15,651
What's up?

589
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,069
Is this even possible?

590
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,278
Is it here?

591
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,156
Is this really a living thing?

592
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,080
Tōkyō Bay Defense Line,

593
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,150
Should we blow up the 4th district to stop

593
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,747
the unidentified creature from intruding?

593
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,208
Just a little bit more.

594
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,089
It will soon enter the 4th district!

595
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:38,924
Now!

596
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,300
Detonate it!

597
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:43,595
Did we do it?

598
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:45,681
It's no good.

599
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,391
It didn't seem to work.

600
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,765
The blockade of Tōkyō Bay is a failure!

601
00:53:49,765 --> 00:53:51,437
The monster is now heading towards Shinagawa.

601
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,856
It's extremely big!

602
00:54:00,344 --> 00:54:00,904
Thanks.

603
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,212
Breaking news, breaking news!

604
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,850
A giant creature in the Tōkyō Bay

605
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:21,759
is heading towards Ginza.

605
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:23,301
If you are in Ginza,

606
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,141
please follow instructions from the police

606
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:26,472
and begin evacuating immediately.

606
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,015
This is real.

607
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,349
Ginza...

608
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38:268
Are you injured?

610
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,186
Hey, what is that?

611
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,100
What happened?

612
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,562
What's up?

612
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:34,790
That's...

613
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:36,750
...Godzilla?

614
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,331
An unbelievable sight is unfolding!

615
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,117
An incredibly large creature is

616
00:56:59,117 --> 00:57:03,128
rampaging through Ginza!

617
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:07,215
The Nichigeki is beying destroyed right now.

618
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:10,291
All those memories and plays, the Nichigeki...

619
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:14,097
That Nippon Gekijō is now crumbling before our eyes!

620
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:17,309
Ah, what a thing to say!

621
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,823
The town of Ginza,

622
00:57:18,823 --> 00:57:20,270
which survived the air raids from the last war,

623
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,606
is now reduced to a pile of rubble!

624
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,120
Ah, what?

625
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,443
The monster is approaching this direction.

626
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,400
Right now,

627
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29:100
the face of a giant monster is passing

628
00:57:29:100 --> 00:57:31,782
before our very eyes.

628
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,660
It has become very dangerous here as well.

630
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:49,049
Hurry and run away!

631
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,476
You're in the way!

632
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:09,820
Stand up!

633
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,140
Kou-san!

634
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,365
It's no good if you die, hurry!

634
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:58,618
Hooray!

636
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:42,871
This is...

637
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,248
...the same as that time.

638
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:40,303
Noriko?

639
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:43,890
Noriko?

640
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,190
Nori...

641
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:27,662
The damaged caused by the creature is around

642
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:29,775
thirty-thousand killed or injured,

643
01:02:29,775 --> 01:02:33,625
and over twenty-thousand buildings destroyed.

644
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,836
Rescue efforts have been going on since the disaster.

645
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,955
It seems to be difficult to trace the creature

646
01:02:40,955 --> 01:02:42,342
due to the possible risk of radiation.

647
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,620
In addition, around various places in Ginza,

648
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:47,303
what seems to be the giant creature's flesh has been found

649
01:02:47,303 --> 01:02:51,977
and the police are working night and day to dispose of it.

651
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,229
The center of Ginza is sealed off.

652
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,314
Things have turned out so badly...

653
01:03:16,698 --> 01:03:18,211
What about Akiko now?

654
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,488
When we're in trouble,

655
01:03:21,488 --> 01:03:22,924
we help each other out.

655
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:24,843
Aki-chan.

656
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:28,888
Hey.

657
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,434
When your otō-chan isn't around,

658
01:03:31,434 --> 01:03:33,018
you like to come over to your oba-chan's, right?

658
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,562
Where's okaa-chan?

659
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:42,944
Okaa-chan...

660
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:47,500
She's away on a trip for work,

661
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,492
so you'll be with your oba-chan for a while.

663
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,751
So you're not going to forgive me?

664
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:47,717
It's because...

665
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,638
I had a stupid dream.

666
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:07,654
Shiki-san...

667
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,674
A secret operation to defeat Godzilla

668
01:05:12,674 --> 01:05:15,036
is actually underway.

668
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,289
It's a very unsettling...

669
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,751
...civillian-led initiative but...

670
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,464
Would you like to participate in it?

671
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,774
Everyone here is...

672
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,360
Yes, formerly a marine.

673
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,445
You know a lot.

674
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:13,136
I'm Hotta, the former captain of the Yukikaze.

675
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,680
As you all know,

676
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:17,669
Right now, Tōkyō was attacked

677
01:06:17,669 --> 01:06:19,601
by a giant and mysterious creature,

677
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,603
causing an unprecedented crisis.

678
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:23,600
However,

679
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,112
we do not have a military to protect

679
01:06:25,112 --> 01:06:26,774
the citizens of this country.

679
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:30,550
It was found that military action from GHQ

680
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:33,142
would be highly unlikely due to the risk of provoking

680
01:06:33,142 --> 01:06:34,699
the Soviet forces on the continent.

680
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,100
In other words,

681
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:41,623
We must face that monster with civillian power alone.

681
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,919
It is for that purpose that we have gathered you all here.

682
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,510
As a result of negotiations,

683
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,860
they have promised to provide four destroyers that

683
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:52,884
that were going to be given to the allies.

683
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:55,887
Are you...

684
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,932
...saying we have to go on a ship again?

685
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,309
I saw that in Ginza.

686
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,728
I can't beat that type of thing.

687
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:06,231
After all,

688
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,899
disarmed ships can't fight back properly!

689
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:08,200
Yeah!

690
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,446
How are we supposed to fight?

690
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,700
Well regarding those matters,

691
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,488
please allow me to explain to you.

691
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,281
Noda-san?

692
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:17,160
This time...

693
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:21,454
Sorry about that...

694
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,457
This time, the person who devised the plan...

695
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,544
...is me, former Navy technical officer Noda Kenji.

696
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,629
First of all,

697
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,767
according to the legend from Ōdo Island,

698
01:07:32,767 --> 01:07:34,300
this monster is called Godzilla.

698
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:38,930
Godzilla takes almost no damage from normal firemarms.

699
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,306
I saw it right before my eyes.

700
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:44,394
It even got hit by Heavy Cruiser Takao's main gun,

701
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,312
but it quickly regenerated.

702
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,358
So in secret,

703
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:53,236
I came up with another solution.

704
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:56,500
First,

705
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,824
I'm going to show you a simple experiment.

705
01:07:58,408 --> 01:07:59,700
The water in here is salt water with

706
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,661
the same concentration as seawater.

706
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,300
This Godzilla-like wood has a weight attached to it

707
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,833
so that it just barely floats.

707
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:07,649
In this state,

708
01:08:07,649 --> 01:08:09,544
What happens if we pumped freon gas into the tube,

708
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,754
covering the piece of wood with bubbles?

709
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,631
What happens?

710
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,200
Whether or not bubbles comes out,

711
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:15,925
it'll still float.

711
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,282
Yeah, that's obvious.

712
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:19,971
That's what you'd think, right?

713
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:27,572
It sunk!

714
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,567
The bubbles from the freon gas enclose the wood

715
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,944
and prevent it from coming in contact with the seawater.

716
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,594
My plan is that this time, we use this to sink Godzilla,

716
01:08:37,594 --> 01:08:40,491
the monster that attacked Tōkyō, to the bottom of the sea.

717
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,625
Hey,

718
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,954
the Acedemic is a surprisingly awesome guy, isn't he?

719
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,150
As you know,

720
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:02,625
Sagami Trench off of the coast is more than

720
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:03,723
1500 meters deep,

720
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,225
an incredible depth for waters off the coast.

721
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,461
Our current plan is to attach

722
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:10,188
a large number of freon gas tanks to Godzilla,

722
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,755
and at the same time,

723
01:09:11,755 --> 01:09:13,733
have them envelop it with a curtain of foam.

723
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,28
Within a short period of time,

724
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:17,290
it will sink into Sagami Trench

724
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,529
and the pressure will kill it.

724
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,160
We'll kill Godzilla with the power of the ocean.

725
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:25,800
This is...

726
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,706
...the outline of Operation Wadatsumi.

726
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,084
That thing came from the see.

727
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,753
It isn't bothered by the deep water pressure.

728
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,777
According to my calculations,

729
01:09:36,777 --> 01:09:38,375
after about 25 seconds,

729
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:41,719
1500 tons will be exerted per square meter.

729
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,097
Even creatures that can normally survive in the deep sea

730
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,100
cannot with stand these types of rapid pressure changes.

731
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,059
That and...

732
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,437
Can you absolutely kill Godzilla?

733
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,235
There's a lot we don't know about Godzilla's ecology,

734
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:58,670
so we can only create countermeasures against it

735
01:09:58,670 --> 01:09:59,445
based on our predictions.

735
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:02,000
That's bullcrap, isn't it?

736
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,300
However, since artillery fire is ineffective,

737
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,077
this is the best solution.

737
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,115
Can you kill him?

738
01:10:07,115 --> 01:10:08,329
Or can you not?

738
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,292
I can't say for sure.

739
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:16,671
Shikishima!

740
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:18,673
There is a possibility!

741
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:24,929
Shiki-san...

742
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,099
Listen until the end!

743
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,077
Now, for a detailed explanation,

744
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,830
Using two destroyers,

745
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:57,044
we'll wrap the cable around Godzilla.

745
01:10:58,045 --> 01:10:59,940
The cable is already equipped with

746
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:03,760
a large amount of freon gas tanks.

746
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,190
As soon as it's wrapped around Godzilla,

747
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:09,474
all of the foam releases,

747
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:14,812
and Godzilla is pulled down 1500 meters into the deep sea.

748
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:16,481
But what if that doesn't work?

749
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:18,149
Then we have a backup plan.

750
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:20,800
Everyone,

751
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,403
please look at the courtyard.

751
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:41,589
Deploy!

752
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:50,139
I'm Itagaki from Tōyō Baloon.

753
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:53:983
What you just saw is an inflatable floatation device

754
01:11:53:983 --> 01:11:57,814
inspired by the ones installed on former Naval aircraft.

755
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:01,236
This so-called floating bag gains buoyancy by having

756
01:12:01,236 --> 01:12:03,110
Carbon Dioxide blown into the air sacs.

757
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:07,118
Now, this can bring Godzilla,

758
01:12:07,118 --> 01:12:08,444
who will have reached the bottom of the ocean,

758
01:12:08,444 --> 01:12:10,451
all the way back up to the surface.

758
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:13,104
Even if it is able to withstand high pressure,

759
01:12:13,104 --> 01:12:15,206
I don't think it will be able to withstand

759
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,166
the massive decompression that will follow it.

760
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,400
Of course,

761
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,546
I cannot say for sure that we will defeat it.

761
01:12:21,629 --> 01:12:24,006
But the only thing we can do now is what we can.

762
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,514
To all those who survived the war,

763
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:35,500
I am sorry to ask you to take on a

764
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,490
life-threatening mission again,

764
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:38:100
but...

764
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,689
I want you to understand.

764
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,089
Now that neither the Japanese government

765
01:12:42,089 --> 01:12:43,442
nor American government can help us out,

765
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:45,736
we are the only ones who can shape

766
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,196
the future for this country.

766
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:51,659
It's impossible.

767
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:55,454
I have a family.

768
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:56,818
I just can't do it.

769
01:12:56,818 --> 01:12:58,416
That goes for most people here.

769
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,872
Why are we the only ones

770
01:13:00,872 --> 01:13:02,920
drawing the short straws?

770
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,757
I don't want this to be like the war.

771
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,223
Quiet down.

772
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,786
Everyone,

773
01:13:15,786 --> 01:13:17,059
I want you to listen carefully.

773
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,729
This is not an order.

774
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:23,316
Those with personal situations are free to leave.

775
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,361
We have no right to stop you from doing so.

776
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:52,637
This...

777
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:56,307
We're not going to die for sure, right?

778
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,726
Of course not!

779
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:02,265
Well,

780
01:14:02,265 --> 01:14:04,148
then it's much better than wartime!

781
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,111
Someone has to do it.

782
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,948
It can't be helped, can it?

783
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:14,325
Without us, the ships won't be able to move.

784
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,786
That's right!

785
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,731
All right!

786
01:14:18,731 --> 01:14:19,580
Let's do it!

787
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,091
Everyone...

788
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:33,719
Thank you.

789
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,897
But...

790
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,200
I still can't believe you're the one who

791
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,300
planned this type of operation.

792
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,779
I've encountered Godzilla in real life.

793
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:54,532
That's why they gave me the green light.

794
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:58,077
They called us in for the same reason, didn't they?

795
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,080
Do you think it'll return?

796
01:15:02,304 --> 01:15:05,584
Due to just recently landing in Tōkyō,

797
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,671
you can see it as an addition to Godzilla's territory.

798
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:09,964
Worst case scenario...

799
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:13,801
Godzilla appears again within the next ten days.

800
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,136
That's early!

801
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:15,810
Apparently,

802
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:18,139
they've placed lots of radition-detecting buoys.

802
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:21,058
We can't soley rely on our eyes to detect it.

803
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,600
First off, if you set a trap for it,

804
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,700
are you expecting it to come up and say,

805
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:25,563
"Oh, it that the case?"

805
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,189
That's it.

806
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,357
Hey, that's impossible.

807
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,177
Please don't make fun of me.

807
01:15:30,177 --> 01:15:32,319
I'm thinking about it carefully.

808
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,300
There's an loudspeaker that's used for

808
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,575
underwater acoustic minesweeping.

809
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:39,076
Using that,

810
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,543
we'll play back the recorded sound of Godzilla

811
01:15:41,543 --> 01:15:42,371
from his most recent appearance.

811
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:43,539
The sound of Godzilla?

812
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:44,498
Yes.

813
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,305
Godzilla will chase after another being because

814
01:15:47,305 --> 01:15:48,711
it'll feel like it's territory is being invaded.

814
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:50,087
At least he should.

815
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:51,589
"Should?"

816
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,466
It's always "should."

817
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,140
And what's even the point of that...

818
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:56,635
levitation-floating-device-thing?

818
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,513
I don't feel like it's gonna work.

819
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,849
Then what are you saying I should do?

820
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:02,310
Yes, yes!

821
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:05,227
How about we use a destroyer to pull it up?

821
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:06,687
Don't say stupid things.

822
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,439
Godzilla weighs around 20,000 tons.

823
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:10,733
The thrust of two destroyers just isn't enough.

824
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:17,239
In a nutshell, your plan is full of holes.

825
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:19,700
If you're going to say those types of things,

826
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,952
then please provide an alternative plan.

826
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:25,414
Noda-san.

827
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:28,492
Do you have any connections

828
01:16:29,562 --> 01:16:30,586
to fighter jets somewhere?

828
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:32,588
Fighter jets?

829
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,799
In the unlikely event it appears on land,

830
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36:000
we can anger it with gunfire

831
01:16:36:000 --> 01:16:37,426
and lure it back to Sagami Bay.

831
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:39,165
After they were disarmed,

832
01:16:39,165 --> 01:16:40,570
all of them were burned down,

832
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:40,971
the Japanese fighter jets.

832
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,253
Even if there were some left,

833
01:16:43,253 --> 01:16:45,309
it breathes Heat Rays.

833
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:47,489
Guiding it with an aircraft would be

834
01:16:47,489 --> 01:16:48,229
a very dangerous job.

834
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,314
I don't care if it's dangerous.

835
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:54,068
Fighter jets are more mobile than ships anyways.

836
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:57,071
Are you aiming to get shot down on purpose?

837
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,836
Are you just...

838
01:16:58,836 --> 01:17:00,449
Desperate?

838
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:02,952
Are you drunk?

839
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,996
You just want to avenge Nori-chan.

840
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:08,249
And you've got a problem with that, don't you?

841
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,292
Now that...

842
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,775
Why didn't you take Nori-chan as your wife

843
01:17:13,775 --> 01:17:16,173
before all this happened?

843
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:18,050
You knew how she felt about it, didn't you?

844
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:20,886
I wanted to do that too!

845
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,973
So why?

846
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,101
My...

847
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:36,026
war hasn't ended.

848
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,970
There were fighter jets?

849
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:05,890
Yep, but it's a very special one...

850
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,600
It's a local fighter jet designed

851
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,150
near the end of the war

851
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:30,247
called The Shinden.

851
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,959
Specially designed for hit-and-run bombing attacks.

852
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,045
The maximum speed is over 400 knots.

853
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,163
It has a canard design,

854
01:18:38,163 --> 01:18:39,423
and it's equipped with four 30mm guns.

854
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:42,179
It's an innovative aircraft

855
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:43,752
that boasts exceptional weaponary

855
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:45,387
and incorporates many new inventions.

855
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,874
Apparently, only a few prototypes

856
01:18:47,874 --> 01:18:49,934
were ever actually deployed in combat.

856
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:51,925
They were deployed here

857
01:18:51,925 --> 01:18:53,892
for the final battle on the mainland,

857
01:18:53,892 --> 01:18:55:190
but they were forgotten about

857
01:18:55:190 --> 01:18:56,857
in the confusion after the war.

857
01:18:57,608 --> 01:19:00,720
Since it was left unattended for so long,

858
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,570
the aircraft often goes rattle-rattle.

858
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,157
I can't fly it like this...

859
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,700
That's the problem.

860
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,327
A good mechanic...

861
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,621
No...

862
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:11,100
A person who can repair this aircraft

862
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,331
is what we need.

862
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:18,462
I have a person in mind.

863
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:25,511
Former Ōdo Island Mechanic Tachibana Sōsaku-san?

864
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:26,512
Yes.

865
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,390
Tachibana, Tachibana, Tachibana, Tachibana...

866
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:33,227
He currently doesn't have an address registered.

867
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:34,228
I see.

868
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:37,439
We get tons of requests to look for people every day.

869
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:39,692
It'll take a while for us to find him.

870
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,611
I need to talk to him about some very urgent matters!

871
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44:180
You're in a difficult situation.

871
01:19:44:180 --> 01:19:45,572
Even if you say that...

872
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:46,530
Please!

873
01:19:46,879 --> 01:19:47,700
Just do it!

873
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,119
The survival of the country depends on it!

874
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,833
Even if that's true,

875
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:53,580
I can't do what's not possible.

875
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:54,498
I'm sorry.

876
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:55,916
Well then...

877
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,419
Do you know which unit Tachibana belonged to

878
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:01,422
before he switched over to Ōdo Island?

878
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:11,140
I'm doing all that I can...

879
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:15,394
But I can't get in touch with Tachibana-san.

880
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:17,682
There are many other excellent

881
01:20:17,682 --> 01:20:19,315
former maintenance personnel.

881
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:21,358
Why don't you just try a different one?

882
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,110
Please give me a little more time.

883
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,114
Why are you so obsessed with that person?

884
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,283
There's no telling when Godzilla will return.

885
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,285
It's no good if it's not Tachibana!

886
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,288
He's gonna recieve my message soon.

887
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:36,874
Please!

888
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:05,700
Tachibana...

889
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08:583
Tachibana-san!

890
01:21:08:583 --> 01:21:09,239
It's you, Tachibana-san!

890
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:16,038
What's the meaning of this?

891
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:20,793
Ah!

892
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:25,921
You're saying the deaths on Ōdo Island

893
01:21:25,921 --> 01:21:27,758
were all my fault?

893
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,428
What's up with that?

894
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:33,263
Sorry...

895
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:35,870
I knew that if I said that,

896
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:39,269
you'd get angry and come over here.

896
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:40,813
Shame on you!

897
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:45,651
That thing that attacked Ginza...

898
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:47,694
was...

899
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:50,864
Godzilla from Ōdo Island.

900
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:02,876
Our fighter jets need to be upgraded.

901
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,795
That way, I'll be able to defeat it!

902
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:07,971
I really needed to meet up with you...

903
01:22:07,971 --> 01:22:10,384
so I could ask you do do that!

903
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,512
That's why I sent the fake letters.

904
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:16,849
Please forgive me!

905
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,106
Do whatever you want.

906
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,317
There's no way I'm gonna help you.

907
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:28,900
Tachibana-san!

908
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,238
Please wait, Tachibana-san!

908
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,602
Please wait for a second!

909
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,949
Tachibana-san!

909
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,410
There's something I'd like for you to do.

910
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:40,164
Something that only you can do, Tachibana-san.

911
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:44,668
I once detonated a mine inside of Godzilla's mouth.

912
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,628
It was far more effective than the guns on the Takao.

913
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:49,360
He's weak to attacks from the inside.

914
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:49,631
Do you understand?

914
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,218
You...

915
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,460
I'm going to take a fighter jet full of bombs

916
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:57,890
and fly it into that thing's mouth.

916
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,892
That will definently kill it!

917
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:08,025
A suicide attack?

918
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:11,841
Your war...

919
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:17,326
...isn't over either.

919
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:23,665
Ah, so you fell down?

920
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:24,583
Ow!

921
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:27,377
It's swelling up again pretty badly.

922
01:23:28,561 --> 01:23:31,381
It's a little embarrassing since I was drunk.

923
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:33,509
I don't really remember what happened.

924
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:35,200
Well, it's no wonder you were so excited after

925
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,303
finding Tachibana-san, who you were

925
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:38,764
very particular about wanting.

926
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:41,975
A canard aircraft?

927
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:45,604
I heard rumors about it, it actually was built?

928
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,066
Tachibana-san.

929
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,236
Everyone, thank you for coming!

930
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:54,321
Are you Tachibana-san?

931
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:58,586
Is this...

932
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,828
The legendary local fighter jet Shinden?

932
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:02,869
Yes.

933
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:05,249
Can you fix it so we can fly it?

933
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:11,004
We'll try everything we can.

934
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:12,756
Thank you.

935
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:14,697
Thank you.

936
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,426
Thank you.

936
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:35,946
What's wrong?

937
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,570
If you make a face like that, planner-sama,

938
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:39,533
it's bad for morale.

938
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:41,952
I know I made this operation, but...

939
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:44,123
I started to feel like it would

940
01:24:44,123 --> 01:24:46,331
take a miracle for the operation to succeed.

940
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:47,749
Even so...

941
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,138
The miracle won't happen

942
01:24:49,138 --> 01:24:50,836
if you don't do anything.

942
01:24:51,404 --> 01:24:52,379
That's true, isn't it?

943
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,192
And look at that.

944
01:24:55,162 --> 01:24:55,924
They're smiling.

944
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:59,553
They aren't idiots.

945
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:01,300
They know well that this is a tough operation

946
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,931
that risks their lives.

946
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,600
Even so...

947
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:10,314
Everyone looks so happy.

948
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:14,026
Maybe this time, they can be helpful.

949
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:17,446
Be helpful...

950
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:21,700
We all survived the war.

951
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:23,254
That's why I said,

952
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:25,954
"this time."

952
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,179
Hurry up!

953
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,392
Please make room.

954
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:50,169
1 hour ago,

955
01:25:50,169 --> 01:25:52,500
off of the East Coast of Hacijō Island

955
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:56,151
at 33°10'N 140°01'E,

955
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:27,901
It was reported that the installed Geiger counters

956
01:25:27,901 --> 01:25:59,780
have detected a reaction.

956
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:03,867
And then here and here.

957
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,926
Godzilla's approaching.

959
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:25,430
Reverse-calculating from this speed,

960
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:28,822
Godzilla will arrive at the trench off the coast

961
01:26:28,822 --> 01:26:29,810
Sagami Bay at 11:00 in the morning.

961
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:31,436
In order to confront it,

962
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,232
we will depart tomorrow morning at 8:00.

964
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:38,527
However...

965
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,488
Will the device be completed by then?

966
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:44,866
Please take us with you.

967
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,411
The three hours it takes to reach the site are precious.

968
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:49,246
As an engineer, I want it to be perfect.

969
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:49,971
But...

970
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:52,916
You might get stuck in the fight with Godzilla.

970
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:55,752
We all came back from the war too.

971
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:02,631
Everyone,

972
01:27:03,516 --> 01:27:04,532
if possible,

972
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:06,512
please go home tonight

972
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,849
and spend time with your families.

973
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:11,893
Are you saying to be prepared?

974
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:18,400
If you think about it...

975
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:20,183
If you think about it,

976
01:27:20,183 --> 01:27:23,989
this country has wasted too many lives.

976
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:27,200
Tanks with vulnerable armor...

977
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,379
Due to negligance of supplies,

978
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:32,244
most deaths in battle

978
01:27:32,244 --> 01:27:34,166
are from starvation and disease.

978
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:40,589
The fighters didn't even have basic escape methods,

979
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:46,344
in the end being suicide attacks and gyokusai...

980
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:49,973
So this time...

981
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,291
I want to be proud of this civillian-led operation

982
01:27:56,635 --> 01:27:59,483
for not having a single casualty.

982
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,954
The battle this time,

983
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,281
It's not a fight to the death.

984
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:10,118
It's a fight to live in the future.

985
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:15,957
Let's do it!

986
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:25,579
It's finally happening tomorrow!

987
01:28:25,579 --> 01:28:26,510
I'm trembling with excitement!

988
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:28,136
You're not coming with us.

989
01:28:30,603 --> 01:28:31,556
What do you mean?

990
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,018
Well, that arm isn't gonna do you any good.

991
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,562
Shikishima's going too, right?

992
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,940
Is it because I don't have any war experience?

993
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:42,192
Do you really think I'm useless?

994
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:48,156
Kid, you're lucky that you didn't go to war.

995
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,915
I want to protect this country too!

996
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:02,420
Why can't I come with you?

997
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:07,884
We've been together for a while now!

998
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:10,720
Please!

999
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,515
Please take me with you too!

1000
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:16,059
I want to go with you too!

1001
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:18,728
I leave this country to you.

1002
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:20,522
Captain!

1003
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,065
Noda-san!

1005
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:55,515
See you, Aki-chan.

1007
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,862
Thank you for everything.

1008
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:24,609
Akiko.

1009
01:30:24,609 --> 01:30:26,171
Did you have fun at oba-chan's house?

1009
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,672
It was fun.

1010
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:29,205
I see.

1011
01:30:29,205 --> 01:30:30,133
That's good.

1011
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:36,014
Are you giving that to me?

1012
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:38,850
Thanks.

1013
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:45,815
Akiko.

1014
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:46,858
Hmm?

1015
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:51,071
Is this okaa-chan and me and you, Akiko?

1016
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:54,574
Okaa's in it, too.

1017
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:56,785
I see.

1018
01:30:58,411 --> 01:30:59,788
You drew it well.

1019
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:12,842
Why are you making that face?

1020
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:19,015
What's wrong?

1021
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:20,558
Akiko.

1022
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:23,436
Hey!

1023
01:31:25,480 --> 01:32:29,334
Hey, it's okay!

1024
01:32:29,334 --> 01:31:30,402
I'm not going anywhere...

1024
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:48,271
Tachibana-san.

1025
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:51,316
Can you deploy it?

1026
01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:56,279
I'll get it ready now.

1027
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,751
The ordered bomb.

1028
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,154
Two machine guns, 140 kilograms,

1029
01:33:13,154 --> 01:33:15,590
120 rounds, 80 kilograms, and...

1029
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:17,104
One of the main fuel tanks,

1030
01:33:17,104 --> 01:33:18,468
400 kilograms, was removed.

1030
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:21,288
Instead, this plane was fitted with a No. 25 bomb

1031
01:33:21,288 --> 01:33:23,848
in the nose and a No. 50 bomb in the fuselage.

1031
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,103
Now, I can finally repay my debt.

1032
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:43,827
It's funny...

1033
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,542
I feel like I want to live.

1034
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:57,799
Those who died that day felt like that too.

1035
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,844
Everyone wanted to come back alive.

1036
01:34:02,512 --> 01:34:06:042
But their wishes weren't granted.

1037
01:34:06:042 --> 01:34:07,851
They were killed like insects.

1037
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:11,229
I understand.

1038
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,880
The kid who drew this is named "Akiko."

1039
01:34:38,882 --> 01:34:40,884
I want you to protect her future.

1040
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,492
I'll kill Godzilla no matter what,

1041
01:34:47,492 --> 01:34:48,892
even if it means I have to kill myself.

1041
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:51,978
It seems like you finally made up your mind.

1042
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:56,671
All right,

1043
01:34:56,671 --> 01:34:57,942
I'm gonna tell you something important.

1043
01:34:58,860 --> 01:34:59,861
Look.

1044
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:03,198
This is the bomb's safety device.

1045
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:05,700
Pull it out right before you plunge into him.

1046
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:06,701
Okay?

1047
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:10,163
And...

1048
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,466
Aki-chan.

1049
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:26,429
What's wrong? Are you lonely?

1050
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:28,556
Here.

1052
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:03,883
Otō-chan...

1053
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,552
Hmm? Otō-chan?

1054
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:08,721
Otō-chan...

1055
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:11,516
It's okay, it's okay.

1056
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:33,663
This is Kuroshio 12, 35°03'N, 139°41'E.

1057
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:35,456
A bunch of deep-sea fish emerging were spotted!

1058
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:57,103
Godzilla spotted in Sagami Bay!

1059
01:36:57,186 --> 01:36:59,640
Currently, we are trying to use an underwater

1060
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:03,359
loudspeaker to guide it to the area of the operation.

1060
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,236
Advance schedule for each ship!

1061
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:08,364
Let's hurry up and board the ship!

1062
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:09,532
Let's hurry!

1063
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:13,870
Looks like Mizushima-kun gave up.

1064
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:15,538
I feel bad for him, but it can't be helped.

1065
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:18,333
I actually don't want Shiki-san to fly either.

1066
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:21,044
Isn't Shiki-san a suicide attack survivor?

1067
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:22,086
Seems impossible.

1068
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,600
Akiko is here.

1069
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,298
He'll definently come back.

1069
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:38,144
Underwater loudspeaker destroyed.

1070
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:40,710
Godzilla has invaded Sagami Bay.

1071
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:43,566
Wadatsumi Squadron, set sail immediately.

1071
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:45,360
Hey!

1072
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:47,487
Over there!

1073
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,572
It's here already?

1074
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:02,960
Godzilla breaks through the final defense zone!

1075
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:04,462
Landing is imminent!

1076
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:06,130
I'm leaving!

1077
01:39:01,436 --> 01:39:03,479
With this, you're going to end it all.

1078
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:06,190
Shikishima.

1079
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,526
Depart from port immediately.

1080
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:11,965
Repeat, all ships of the Wadatsumi Squadron

1081
01:39:11,965 --> 01:39:13,364
are to depart from port immediately.

1081
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,200
What should we do?

1081
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,790
The plan's completely falling apart!

1082
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:24,959
Even so, we'll still set sail.

1083
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:27,700
The missles must be fired from the coast of Sagami Bay,

1084
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,672
where they'll have the greatest effect.

1084
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:33,426
All we can do is rely on Shiki-san to lure it.

1085
01:39:33,509 --> 01:39:34,510
Yes!

1086
01:39:34,594 --> 01:39:36,220
Let's do it!

1087
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:52,669
Noda-san!

1088
01:39:52,669 --> 01:39:54,113
It's from Shikishima-san!

1088
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:58,242
This is Shikishima, takeoff was a success.

1089
01:39:58,326 --> 01:40:00,495
Now luring Godzilla into the operation area.

1090
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:02,622
We'll be ready soon too.

1091
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:03,998
So let's get to the operation area quickly...

1092
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:05,570
Shikishima!

1093
01:40:05,570 --> 01:40:06,876
Don't do anything crazy!

1093
01:40:06,959 --> 01:40:08,350
If you leave Akiko all alone,

1094
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:09,212
I'll never forgive you!

1094
01:40:12,465 --> 01:40:14,300
Can you hear me, Shikishima?

1095
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:17,929
Damn it, he's ignoring me...

1096
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:43,079
Telegram!

1097
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,039
Yes...

1098
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:52,588
Yes?

1099
01:40:52,672 --> 01:40:54,173
Are you Shikishima-san?

1100
01:40:56,509 --> 01:40:57,343
It's a telegram.

1101
01:40:57,426 --> 01:40:58,386
Yes.

1103
01:42:23,402 --> 01:42:25,431
That's a big deal!

1104
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:29,352
Godzilla's quite pissed off.

1105
01:42:29,435 --> 01:42:30,519
It's in pursuit.

1106
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:32,647
It's our turn, isn't it?

1107
01:42:35,858 --> 01:42:37,234
All ships, prepare for battle!

1108
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:39,862
All ships, prepare for battle!

1109
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:43,407
Freon cylinders, all right!

1110
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:45,159
46cm shells, all right!

1111
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:46,535
Floatation device switch, all right!

1112
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:48,162
Concentration cables, all right!

1113
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:50,539
All circuits connected!

1114
01:42:50,623 --> 01:42:53,376
Checking power and releasing the safety.

1115
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:12,353
All right, nice!

1116
01:43:14,063 --> 01:43:15,856
Unit 1, attack as planned.

1117
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:18,234
As planned!

1118
01:43:49,306 --> 01:43:51,058
Nice!

1119
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:28,510
That's...

1120
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:30,347
Godzilla's Heat Ray.

1120
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:35,311
It's impossible to do this type of thing!

1121
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:36,489
Captain!

1122
01:44:36,489 --> 01:44:38,314
I recommend evacuating the ship right now!

1122
01:44:38,397 --> 01:44:39,690
No. This is good.

1123
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:41,275
Please start the operation immediately.

1124
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:43,194
But when will Heat Ray come again?

1125
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:44,403
As I told you,

1126
01:44:44,487 --> 01:44:45,707
Once the Heat Ray is used,

1127
01:44:45,707 --> 01:44:47,490
it takes time to regenerate it.

1127
01:44:48,073 --> 01:44:49,200
Now!

1128
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:51,660
Please make up your mind!

1129
01:44:57,166 --> 01:44:59,251
Operation Wadatsumi begins!

1130
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:20,093
Start to deploy the 46cm shells, cylinders,

1131
01:45:20,093 --> 01:45:21,857
and floatation devices!

1131
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:48,843
Shiki-san!

1132
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:15,953
Crane deployed!

1133
01:46:16,036 --> 01:46:17,037
Copy that!

1134
01:46:17,872 --> 01:46:19,832
Send to Hibiki, maintain course.

1135
01:46:20,332 --> 01:46:22,626
Hibiki, maintain course.

1136
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:24,318
I don't mind a little damage,

1137
01:46:24,318 --> 01:46:25,963
we're going to maintain this level of speed!

1137
01:46:30,426 --> 01:46:32,928
Hibiki approaching, 4 meters.

1138
01:46:34,013 --> 01:46:35,097
2 meters.

1139
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:37,182
Brace for impact.

1140
01:46:37,266 --> 01:46:38,726
Brace for impact!

1141
01:46:53,616 --> 01:46:54,901
Cross complete!

1142
01:46:54,901 -->01:46:55,618
Full speed ahead!

1142
01:46:55,701 --> 01:46:56,829
Full speed ahead!

1143
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:58,162
Full speed ahead!

1143
01:47:12,927 --> 01:47:14,349
All right...

1144
01:47:14,349 --> 01:47:15,429
All right!

1145
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:17,181
Chou-san, switch!

1146
01:47:26,607 --> 01:47:27,946
Crap.

1147
01:47:27,946 --> 01:47:28,901
Already?

1147
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:31,320
Almost...

1148
01:47:42,081 --> 01:47:43,916
Ready...

1149
01:47:53,509 --> 01:47:54,510
Chou-san, now!

1150
01:47:57,638 --> 01:47:58,637
Cylinder!

1151
01:47:58,637 --> 01:47:59,264
All right!

1151
01:48:15,906 --> 01:48:18,409
Depth: 1200.

1152
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:20,494
1300.

1153
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,954
1400.

1154
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:23,163
Go!

1155
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:24,915
Go!

1156
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:27,626
1500.

1157
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:30,087
Target depth reached!

1158
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:45,019
Godzilla has gone silent!

1159
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:46,478
Did we do it?

1160
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:55,863
Stubborn bastard!

1161
01:48:56,447 --> 01:48:57,781
Moving to the backup plan.

1162
01:48:57,865 --> 01:48:59,033
Do it.

1163
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:19,261
Come up here!

1164
01:49:19,887 --> 01:49:21,805
Depth: 1200.

1165
01:49:22,306 --> 01:49:23,872
1100!

1166
01:49:23,872 --> 01:49:24,308
1000!

1166
01:49:32,858 --> 01:49:34,193
The cables have stopped!

1167
01:49:34,777 --> 01:49:36,904
They stopped at a depth of 803!

1168
01:49:38,489 --> 01:49:39,860
Why?


1169
01:49:39,860 --> 01:49:40,324
Why did they stop?

1169
01:49:45,037 --> 01:49:46,455
He chewed them all apart.

1170
01:49:49,666 --> 01:49:50,502
To Hibiki!

1171
01:49:50,502 --> 01:49:52,086
We'll pull from all directions to lift up Godzilla.

1171
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:53,754
Full speed ahead at 90 degrees!

1172
01:49:53,837 --> 01:49:56,423
But the thrust of 2 ships isn't enough.

1173
01:49:57,007 --> 01:49:58,550
There's no other options!

1174
01:49:58,634 --> 01:50:00,010
Do everything you can!

1175
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:01,762
Yes!

1176
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:19,931
If this continues,

1177
01:50:19,931 --> 01:50:21,740
the crane won't be able to hold it anymore!

1177
01:50:21,824 --> 01:50:23,242
It's no good!

1179
01:50:45,514 --> 01:50:50,292
This is the Yokohama Tugboat company's Fujimaru.

1180
01:50:50,292 --> 01:50:52,354
We'll do our best to help out.

1180
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:53,897
That voice...

1181
01:50:54,731 --> 01:50:56,770
It's Mizushima.

1182
01:50:56,770 --> 01:50:57,526
Are you the captain?

1182
01:50:58,652 --> 01:51:00,821
Kid! It's you?

1183
01:51:01,738 --> 01:51:02,614
Yes!

1184
01:51:02,698 --> 01:51:06,493
This is Koeimaru, another ship from Tōyō Kisen.

1185
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,631
We, the Nikkōmaru from Yokohama Tugboat Co.,

1186
01:51:08,631 --> 01:51:10,205
will cooperate.

1186
01:51:10,205 --> 01:51:11,999
Shiokazemaru will assist you.

1187
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:13,369
Tetsuyūmaru.

1188
01:51:13,369 --> 01:51:14,285
Nanamimaru.

1188
01:51:14,285 --> 01:51:14,585
Minamimaru.

1188
01:51:14,668 --> 01:51:15,955
Kisshōmaru.

1188
01:51:15,934 --> 01:51:16,871
Junseimaru.

1188
01:51:17,492 --> 01:51:18,130
Heimitsumaru.

1189
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:19,600
Tenyūmaru.

1189
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:20,333
Kaiōmaru.

1189
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:20,633
Yūga.

1190
01:51:21,008 --> 01:51:22,295
Chōkamaru.

1190
01:51:21,553 --> 01:51:23,211
Jūseimaru.

1190
01:51:23,211 --> 01:51:23,511
Taramaru.

1190
01:51:23,511 --> 01:51:23,760
Yasagamaru.

1191
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:26,889
Please stop calling me "useless!"

1192
01:51:28,765 --> 01:51:30,017
All right!

1193
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,977
You don't say.

1194
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:35,063
I'm both surprised and impressed with him.

1195
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:36,732
Get the tugboats!

1196
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:38,775
All the ships will pull up Godzilla!

1197
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:40,652
Get the tugboats!

1198
01:51:40,736 --> 01:51:42,696
Get the tugboats!

1199
01:52:07,304 --> 01:52:10,224
The depth has started increasing!

1200
01:52:11,642 --> 01:52:14,728
Come up here, come up here!

1201
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:17,773
Depth: 700.

1202
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:20,400
Raise, raise, raise...

1203
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:52,933
It's not damaged enough!

1204
01:52:53,892 --> 01:52:56,061
All ships take evasive action!

1205
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:48,530
What's he going to do?

1206
01:53:48,613 --> 01:53:49,698
No way!

1207
01:53:53,535 --> 01:53:54,411
That can't be!

1208
01:53:54,494 --> 01:53:55,244
It's no good!

1209
01:53:55,850 --> 01:53:57,331
Shikishima!

1209
01:54:24,441 --> 01:54:25,442
Shikishima...

1210
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:42,250
No, that!

1211
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:48,256
I see...

1212
01:54:49,966 --> 01:54:51,468
I see.

1213
01:54:54,137 --> 01:54:57,599
The crew member escaped safely.

1214
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:08,652
This seat serves as an escape device.

1215
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:11,696
Pull that lever to activate it.

1216
01:55:15,409 --> 01:55:16,535
Live.

1217
01:55:19,037 --> 01:55:20,372
Tachibana-san.

1218
01:56:51,046 --> 01:56:52,130
Shikishima!

1219
01:56:57,636 --> 01:56:58,762
You did it!

1220
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:00,889
You did it!

1221
01:57:02,974 --> 01:57:04,226
Kid!

1222
01:57:08,271 --> 01:57:09,105
Sumiko-san!

1223
01:57:09,189 --> 01:57:10,357
Kōichi-san!

1224
01:57:11,316 --> 01:57:12,526
Kōichi-san...

1225
01:57:12,609 --> 01:57:13,818
Akiko...

1226
01:57:20,325 --> 01:57:21,284
Eh?

1227
01:58:02,993 --> 01:58:04,744
Kou-san, is your war...

1228
01:58:06,955 --> 01:58:08,290
Over?
