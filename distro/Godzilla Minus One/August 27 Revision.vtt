WEBVTT

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:24.751
Let's go!

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:26.003
Ready, go!

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.715
No abnormalities were detected in the engine.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:30.799
Copy that.

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:32.259
No abnormalities were detected in the fuel system.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:33.218
Copy that.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.978
You're Lieutenant Shikishima, right?

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.899
I'm Tachibana, from the Tsukuba Naval Air Group's maintenance squadron.

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.067
Do you remember me?

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:50.485
Tachibana-san!

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.113
Of course! Thank you for your help during that time.

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:54.031
Yes.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:02:01.663
Wow, you managed to land that low-quality aircraft
on this hole-filled runway.

00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:04.207
As usual, your skills appear to be reliable.

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.502
Even though my results in mock ariel combat are good,

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:10.047
going into a real battle with no experience is different.

00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:15.552
Lukcily, a malfunction in the aircraft gave you some extra time.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.681
Actually...

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:24.311
No matter how hard I try, I can't find the
error you're talking about.

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:29.650
What are you saying?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.094
Isn't it a good thing to have people like you?

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:07.437
Even if you obey an order like "go die,"

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:10.190
the outcome of this war is already clear.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.165
- Give me a gun!
- Yes!

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:09.916
An enemy attack?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.585
- I'm not sure.
- What is it?

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.587
Something big!

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.172
Is it a new weapon for the US military?

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:21.803
Taki!

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:24.139
Taki! It's on the coast!

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.767
Copy that!

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.524
Wahh!!

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:39.988
Taki! Taki-san!

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.698
What is this thing?

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:44.201
- It's Godzilla...
- It's what?

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.994
That's what the guy on the island said.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:48.955
He said that on days like today, when the deep-sea
fish float to the surface, it means Godzilla is coming.

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:50.957
Go... Godzilla?

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:58.632
It's no good.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:04:59.800
Let's get out of here!

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:00.717
Run!

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.344
Run!

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.388
Hey, hurry up!

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.936
Hurry! Run, quickly!

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:15.106
What is that thing?

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.608
We're not sure either.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.486
Lieutenant Shikishima!

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.403
What is it?

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.657
Can you go over there and shoot it with a 20mm?

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:26.076
You're the only person who can shoot it.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.994
We're all just from maintenance squadron.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:31.498
But wouldn't it be bad if it just gets injured?

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.376
No living being can survive being hit by a 20mm!

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.212
Hurry up!
Before it gets within attack range!

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.548
Hurry, hurry!

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.341
Go!

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.343
Hurry!

00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:57.983
Go!

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.124
What is he doing?

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:23.216
Now! Shoot!

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.107
It's coming this way!

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:41.192
What should we do, Tachibana-san?

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.570
Ammo!
Get some bullets!

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.287
Idiot! Don't shoot it!

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.082
Stop, you idiot! Stop!

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.129
Ah!

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.798
Get out! Get out! Get out!

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.133
Hurry and get out of there!

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:11.765
Tachibana-san!

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:19.898
Shoot!

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.608
Ah...

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.000
Tomita!

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.839
Ahh... Ah... Ah...

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:47.217
Ah...

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.514
I'll draw it to the front!

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:53.473
Shoot to kill!

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.133
Why are you guys like this?

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:22.270
Hey!

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.149
Hey!

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.781
Everyone is dead!

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.534
They're dead!

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.372
Hey! It's because you didn't shoot it!

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.378
Damn you!

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.001
Hey!

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.003
Hey!

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.775
Move.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.380
Isn't that loose?

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:13.298
Yes.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:14.674
Pay attention carefully.

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:16.259
It's going to be a pain if things keep dragging on.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:17.594
Yes.

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:27.312
Kōichi-san, is that you?

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:32.317
Ōta-neesan!

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.569
Didn't you go on a suicide attack?

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.488
Eh? Is that not the case?

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.707
And you came back with a calm face?

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.335
Shame on you!

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:56.049
It's because of all the soldiers are cowards that things
are the way they are!

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.386
If you guys had stayed strong...

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.182
...my children wouldn't have died.

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:16.653
Do you know what happened to my parents?

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.954
Everyone died.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:32.043
This area was surrounded by fire.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.006
Your parents too...

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:42.971
Same fate as my children.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.740
"Come back alive."

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.912
That's what you said, right?

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.014
You thief!

00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:29.100
Move! Move, move!

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.811
Get her!
Move! Move!

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:34.063
Huh?

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:36.566
- Please!
- Eh?

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.401
Stop! Stop! Stop right there!

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:39.569
Stop right there!

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:40.987
Hey, that's her, that's her!

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:44.032
Eh...

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.020
Onii-san!

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.984
Finally.

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:22.820
It's your fault, onii-san.

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:25.782
I can't come pick up the baby when you're hanging in an area like that.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.618
Have you been here watching this entire time?

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:34.207
I was getting impatient waiting for you to move, ok?

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:38.169
You're hungry, aren't you?

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:42.340
Why didn't you just leave this kid behind?

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:44.509
Hey!

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:49.639
There's no way I could leave her behind in that place!

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.017
Eh?

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.354
Eh...

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:01.651
Please don't follow me.

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:04.821
If you leave us here like this, both me and the child will die.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.280
I don't know you!

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:14.705
Once you're done, you're going home, all right.

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:18.501
Scary, isn't he? Onii-san is heartless.

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:24.173
What happened to your husband?

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:26.008
Was he taken into the army?

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.720
Do I look like I have a husband?

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.974
Eh? Then whose kid is that?

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.562
- Who cares?
- That's not a good thing!

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.443
During the air raids...

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.946
...this child's dying okaa-san asked me to.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:49.991
So then...

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:53.494
you're not related to that child?

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:55.788
So what?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.501
Are you an idiot?

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.464
You're not in a position to take in a baby
like that and live peacefully!

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:06.299
Even you couldn't abandon it, could you, onii-san?

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.508
Hey!

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.724
Name?

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.480
"Akiko"

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:23.316
No, your name.

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:26.736
Noriko.

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:32.033
Why do you act like that?

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:34.577
If you're acting like you're a vagrant,
it means you're probably poor.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.829
Are you telling me to become a whore?

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.623
Don't give me that look.

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:43.753
In this day and age, it can't be helped if you
don't have any other options.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:51.052
What about your parents and siblings?

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:02.688
Your parents?

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:08.069
Yeah.

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.740
They both died in the air raid.

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.455
You and me are the same, aren't we, onii-san?

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:39.684
Eh?

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.811
Hey, hey! Wait...

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.273
You...

00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:00.329
Hey!

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.250
What's with that?

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:06.919
With what?

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:08.754
Don't play dumb.

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:11.674
The parent and the child you picked up.

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:14.844
Who do you think you are, picking up people like that?

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:18.848
No. They just showed up and settled down without permission.

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:22.476
If you haven't kicked them out, then you picked them up.

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:28.816
Hypocrite...

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:34.739
I'm not dealing with this, sorry to bother you.

00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:40.661
Ah...

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.124
The baby... is she breastfeeding it properly?

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:48.419
Ah, no...

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:51.589
She's not the child's mother.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.175
What is that supposed to mean?

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:09.649
If things continue like this, she'll die of malnutrition.

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:11.359
Right?

00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:13.653
Ah...

00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:16.906
Picking up a child you're not capable of raising...

00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:19.283
What on earth is that all about?

00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:21.535
I'm sorry.

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.796
It's not for you to eat.

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:35.341
Adults can survive no matter what they eat.

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:42.973
Use this to make gruel for the child.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:48.312
Ah, there goes my white rice...

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.649
It's annoying, seriously...

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.160
1946年３月

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.287
Ah, damn it!

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:06.872
I'm soaking wet!

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.375
Damn it...

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:15.256
Did you get a job?

00:20:16.674 --> 00:20:19.260
I did find something, but...

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.178
Eh? What's the problem?

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:22.096
Ah...

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.724
The pay isn't bad either.

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:26.308
Check this out..

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:29.311
It seems that just the preperation money is ¥3000 alone!

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:31.272
That's awesome!

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.111
It has to be a scam.

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:40.406
Just the other day, all the rice that you brought in was stolen.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:43.284
That's not the case with this.

00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:45.494
What's different about it?

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:48.205
It has a stamp of approval from none other than
the Ministry of Demobilization.

00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:51.000
There's a reason that it pays so well.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:52.418
The reason?

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:58.466
During the war, both the US military and Imperial Navy
secretly laid down mines, right?

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:00.634
It's a job to clean that up.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.346
But the pay is insanely good, because...

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:06.098
Well...

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:13.105
There's no guarantee that I'll come back alive, is there?

00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:16.525
What are you talking about?!

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.402
You just made it back alive!

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.446
There's nothinng else we can do!

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:22.907
At this rate, the three of us are going to starve to death!

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.450
Even Akiko will die if it keeps going on like this...

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.205
I understand that, but...

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.000
If we have the money...

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:37.713
If we have the money, we can even buy powdered milk from America!

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:38.672
For that reason, I'd...

00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:41.342
It's no good if you die!

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:46.931
It's okay.

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:51.018
Just becaus it's dangerous doesn't mean I'm going to die.

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:54.730
It's different from the suicide attacks of 10 deaths and no lives.

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:04.865
And besides, I'll be on a special ship so the
magnetic mines won't be able to detect us.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.540
This is... the special ship?

00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:29.640
Hey, you! Are you the one who's going to be our next gunner?

00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:30.641
I'm Shikishima.

00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:31.559
Are you a boat gunner?

00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:32.893
I used to be a fighter pilot.

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:35.354
What? What's this guy for?

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:36.856
You're a former fighter pilot?

00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:39.900
I don't want to be with this wreck of a military shōnen!

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:42.111
Were you disappointed?

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:43.404
That this is what the ship is like?

00:22:44.947 --> 00:22:46.323
The US military and Japan's Imperial Navy laid down
around 60,000 mines along the coast.

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:54.081
Well, there are many different types, but the most
difficult ones are the US's magnetic mines.

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:58.502
If a ship made out of metal passed by, it would react and detonate.

00:23:00.337 --> 00:23:02.464
Ah, so that's why...

00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:05.050
Yep. He catches on quickly.

00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:08.053
Our main responsibility is to clean up moored mines.

00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:11.599
This wooden boat is the best solution to counter magnetic mines.

00:23:14.435 --> 00:23:15.477
I'm Noda.

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:20.107
I developed weapons at the Navy Arsenal during the war.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.735
This is Captain Akitsu and Mizushima-kun.

00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:24.361
You can call this guy "The Kid" and that one "The Academic."

00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:26.739
How do you feel about addressing me like that, chou-san?

00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:28.657
And I'm not a kid anymore!

00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:31.160
You're still only a beginner, so being called a kid is more than enough.

00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:34.538
Yeah, yeah, I haven't gone to war anyway.

00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:36.957
This is the special minesweeper Shinseimaru.

00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:39.001
Paired up with the Kaishinmaru right next to it.

00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:44.089
Mines are like balloons that rise from the ocean floor.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:50.596
We attached cutters to the cables between the
2 ships to cut the mines' wires.

00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:53.140
That will cause the mines to float to the surface.

00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:55.351
So that using this...

00:23:56.518 --> 00:23:58.145
it goes DADADADADA!

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:00.105
Watch us.

00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:13.410
Wow, this one's quite difficult to hit.

00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:15.496
Can I do it?

00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:17.539
Are you sure?

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:24.004
Because it's shaking...

00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:28.133
...you have to predict where the bullet will
land before firing, and...

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.183
Woah!

00:24:37.768 --> 00:24:39.019
Good job!

00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:41.313
It's the same as shooting down an enemy plane.

00:24:41.397 --> 00:24:43.899
Except, well, I was never in an actual battle.

00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:44.984
Eh?

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:47.653
You have no experience in practical combat?

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:50.280
That means Shikishima and I are pretty much the same.

00:24:50.364 --> 00:24:51.281
Idiot. You're completely different.

00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:52.992
You can't fly a plane, can you?

00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:55.995
If I had gone to war, I would've been a great help!

00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:58.956
Ah, if only it lasted a little bit longer...

00:25:01.917 --> 00:25:03.752
Are you seriously saying that?

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.173
I'm sorry.

00:25:12.469 --> 00:25:13.637
Idiot.

00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:40.664
Ah! Stop it!

00:25:43.709 --> 00:25:46.754
Shoot it! Run away!
Evacuate! Evacuate!

00:25:46.837 --> 00:25:48.213
Ah!

00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:59.892
Ah... ah... ahhhh!!

00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:05.272
Are you okay?

00:26:12.863 --> 00:26:14.239
A bad dream again?

00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:23.165
Dr... dream.

00:26:27.211 --> 00:26:28.212
I see...

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.882
It's a dream...

00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:40.140
Or maybe...

00:26:41.892 --> 00:26:43.894
...you're a dream.

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.188
What are you talking about? Are you okay?

00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:48.732
This is Japan, right?

00:26:48.816 --> 00:26:51.360
Isn't it? I'm actually back, right?

00:26:51.443 --> 00:26:52.361
Right?

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:53.320
I came back, didn't I?

00:26:53.403 --> 00:26:54.446
Stop it!

00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:16.593
I understand...

00:27:17.386 --> 00:27:18.470
I know.

00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:21.723
I know.

00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:32.878
Nice place you built here. It's worth all of the money you saved up.

00:28:38.091 --> 00:28:39.176
Please help yourself.

00:28:39.676 --> 00:28:41.678
Ah, this is, this is...

00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:45.974
May I take one?

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.935
Eh? That's...

00:28:48.018 --> 00:28:49.269
That would be a waste of film!

00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:51.021
Ah, that smile!

00:28:51.104 --> 00:28:52.981
Just like that, just like that...

00:28:53.774 --> 00:28:54.524
Yes!

00:28:56.109 --> 00:28:57.736
Thank you.

00:28:57.819 --> 00:29:00.072
Hey, Academic, don't go falling in love with Nori-chan.

00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:04.576
What are you talking about? Noriko-san is a married woman!

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.996
Please stop! I'm not his wife!

00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:12.626
What does that mean?

00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:15.337
She settled down here without my permission.

00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:19.424
I just let her stay because there was nowhere else for her to go...

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.343
Then whose kid is this?

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:25.222
It's her stepchild, though they aren't blood-related.

00:29:25.722 --> 00:29:28.850
She's an orphan that was entrusted to her during the air raids.

00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:30.143
Eh?

00:29:30.894 --> 00:29:32.771
Isn't that a touching story in this day and age?

00:29:32.854 --> 00:29:35.941
No, I'm just not thinking ahead.

00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:39.945
Otō-chan.

00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:44.074
- Akiko.
- Yes?

00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:47.744
I told you. I'm not your tō-chan.

00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:53.375
Shikishima, isn't it a bad idea to say that?

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:54.835
It's really unhealthy.

00:29:55.961 --> 00:30:01.883
Both of you were brought into a family by fate, so
you guys need to be prepared for it.

00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:04.344
Make them happy!

00:30:05.679 --> 00:30:06.680
Shut up!

00:30:07.431 --> 00:30:09.433
I'm not interested in that kind of thing.

00:30:15.022 --> 00:30:16.273
Why?

00:30:31.788 --> 00:30:34.666
Welcome back. I also just returned myself.

00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:36.585
What's with your appearance?

00:30:40.464 --> 00:30:41.381
How does it look?

00:30:42.174 --> 00:30:44.217
I started working as an office worker in Ginza.

00:30:44.301 --> 00:30:45.719
Eh... no...

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:47.471
I've given you enough money though, right?

00:30:53.602 --> 00:30:56.396
I was thinking that I finally wanted to become
independent from you.

00:30:57.689 --> 00:31:01.151
At this rate, Kou-san, you'll never find a wife.

00:31:05.072 --> 00:31:06.239
Did you know?

00:31:06.323 --> 00:31:08.492
Ginza's also recovering very quickly.

00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:10.660
Isn't this a bit soon?

00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:13.288
I've been thinking about this for a while now.

00:31:14.623 --> 00:31:16.208
Ah... what about Akiko?

00:31:17.209 --> 00:31:23.382
What will Akiko do when you leave for work, Noriko-san?

00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:26.218
Sumiko-san will take care of her when I'm at work.

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:27.969
Eh... ah...

00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:29.971
Sumiko-san is very enthusiastic about it.

00:31:30.055 --> 00:31:32.766
She said, "I've raised 3 children myself."

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:38.438
Well if that's the case, it's fine then.

00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:42.651
Well then, I'm gonna go get Akiko.

00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:32.200
It is estimated that these large aquatic creatures will reach the Kantō
region of Japan within a few weeks at the latest.

00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:43.670
Supreme Commander Douglas McAurthur has regrettably announced that
due to the situation with the Soviet Union, military involvement is not possible.

00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:50.302
At the same time, they requested Japan to
strengthen all of it's security agencies.

00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:04.900
This...

00:33:06.026 --> 00:33:07.986
Was it a giant shark?

00:33:09.196 --> 00:33:10.322
A whale?

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:13.492
Sharks and whales can't do this type of damage.

00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:16.036
A new Soviet weapon?

00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:18.079
Does that look like weapon damage to you?

00:33:18.163 --> 00:33:19.623
Then what are you saying?

00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:22.417
I can only assume it was something large like a mountain.

00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:23.627
Like what?

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:26.171
You're just acting arrogant even though you don't
understand any of it either.

00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:29.299
I was being skeptical until I saw this.

00:33:31.927 --> 00:33:32.761
Godzilla.

00:33:34.721 --> 00:33:36.681
Please look at that!

00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:38.058
Ah?

00:33:40.393 --> 00:33:44.523
On the day Godzilla came to the island, deep-sea fish were floating to the top.

00:33:45.232 --> 00:33:47.192
You saw that thing?

00:33:47.275 --> 00:33:51.530
It was a monster that looked like a dinosaur that had survived.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.909
The locals call him Godzilla.

00:33:56.618 --> 00:33:57.452
Godzilla?

00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:00.288
Foolishness.
Does that type of thing even exist?

00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:01.623
You were half-asleep and probably saw an enemy tank-

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:08.505
You probably won't believe me, but that Godzilla wiped out
the entire garrison on Ōdo Island!

00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:10.507
Wait a second...

00:34:11.174 --> 00:34:13.343
I thought unit that got wiped out by the US military?

00:34:15.262 --> 00:34:19.182
Ōdo Island was ignored by the US during Operation Jumping Stone.

00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:23.228
During that time, it was an emergency landing site
for malfunctioning suicide attack planes.

00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:25.605
So then, Shikishima...

00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:28.441
Are you a former suicide attack pilot?

00:34:34.531 --> 00:34:37.409
If this is the same Godzilla as the one from the island...

00:34:38.368 --> 00:34:41.871
...it will have grown bigger and more powerful.

00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:49.337
Please give me a moment...

00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:53.383
Why were we called out here in the first place?

00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:57.554
You're not saying we have to fight that type of thing, right?

00:34:57.637 --> 00:34:58.471
On this type of ship?

00:34:58.555 --> 00:35:00.223
That's the case.

00:35:00.307 --> 00:35:03.602
Eh? That type of thing's impossible!

00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:08.398
What are we supposed to do with this kind of petty ship against
an opponent the US military can't even take down?

00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:10.442
They told us to stall it.

00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:12.944
Stall?

00:35:13.028 --> 00:35:15.739
The Takao is coming from Singapore.

00:35:16.489 --> 00:35:18.450
Eh? Heavy Crusier Takao? That one?

00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:21.953
It was awaiting scuttling, but it appears that
they decided to bring it back.

00:35:22.746 --> 00:35:25.415
Isn't that awesome! The Takao!

00:35:25.498 --> 00:35:29.210
I was ordered to buy time until the Takao arrives.

00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:32.589
This ship is from America-san, right?
Can't they deal with it themselves?

00:35:33.715 --> 00:35:36.843
Things are getting weirder between America
and the Soviet Union right now.

00:35:36.926 --> 00:35:40.388
They can't carelessly take military action.

00:35:40.472 --> 00:35:43.683
They prefer we handle these types of trivial matters.

00:35:43.767 --> 00:35:44.976
Is this a trival matter?

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.562
The only weapons we have is a 13mm gun.

00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:51.191
They said we could use recovered mines for that purpose.

00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:56.112
Haha! So that's why they called us out here.

00:35:56.196 --> 00:36:00.450
The most important weapons are "locally sourced."

00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:04.621
And regarding this, you are not allowed to tell anyone about it.

00:36:04.704 --> 00:36:07.916
There it is. The usual gag order.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.294
This country never changes!

00:36:12.671 --> 00:36:14.047
Can it even change?

00:36:23.473 --> 00:36:24.849
Let's swap places.

00:36:25.975 --> 00:36:28.687
Ah, thank you.

00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:31.564
You're too stuck in your seat, Shiki-san.

00:36:32.691 --> 00:36:35.235
To think that the other opponent could be Godzilla...

00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:38.613
I know how you feel.

00:36:39.447 --> 00:36:45.787
When I think back to the war, sometimes I also have trouble sleeping.

00:36:46.663 --> 00:36:48.123
I want to defeat the enemy.

00:36:48.832 --> 00:36:53.545
But at the same time, I find it incredibly frightening.

00:36:59.801 --> 00:37:03.555
There are only 2 of those, including a spare.

00:37:09.853 --> 00:37:10.937
What's wrong?

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:33.585
The amount of fish on Ōdo Island is nothing compared to
what's happening right now...

00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:39.007
Stay on gaurd! Stay on gaurd!

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.134
Godzilla is coming!

00:37:41.217 --> 00:37:42.761
Stay on gaurd!

00:37:44.554 --> 00:37:46.556
Here he comes!

00:37:47.182 --> 00:37:49.684
Kid, keep your mines read to drop them whenever you want.

00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:51.478
- Yes!
- Shikishima, prepare the machine guns.

00:37:51.561 --> 00:37:54.189
Let's run away! We can't fight it on a ship like this!

00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:55.315
There's still time!

00:37:55.398 --> 00:37:56.775
Let's see how that works out, chou-san!

00:37:56.858 --> 00:37:58.735
Academic, keep your eyes peeled and report back to me.

00:37:58.818 --> 00:37:59.652
Chou-san!

00:37:59.736 --> 00:38:01.529
Shinseimaru to Kaishinmaru!

00:38:02.197 --> 00:38:04.991
It looks like he's about to make an appearance. Get ready!

00:38:05.074 --> 00:38:08.286
We're taking all the credit for defeating the monster.

00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:09.579
- Those bastards!
- Captain!

00:38:09.662 --> 00:38:15.168
If we run away now, the Takao won't make it in time,
so where will the monster head for?

00:38:16.336 --> 00:38:19.047
I don't want to see Tōkyō engulfed in flames again.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.549
But this ship is no match for it.

00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:24.219
Chou-san, I thought you hated government orders, right?

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:26.596
Ah, I do hate them!

00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:27.722
However...

00:38:28.473 --> 00:38:30.558
Someone has to draw the short straw.

00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:50.078
This is just impossible.

00:38:54.374 --> 00:38:55.625
Academic, engine!

00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:57.126
Working on it now!

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:58.878
Shikishima!

00:39:00.463 --> 00:39:01.339
Shikishima!

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:04.175
Hurry up! Hurry over here!

00:39:05.885 --> 00:39:06.886
Captain!

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:08.346
Got it!

00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:09.430
Increase the throttle!

00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:10.348
All right!

00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:32.370
Drop the mines!

00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:35.999
He's almost here! It's too late!

00:39:36.082 --> 00:39:38.209
Even so, we still have to do something!

00:39:57.812 --> 00:39:59.188
Now, kid!

00:39:59.272 --> 00:40:00.690
Here it goes!!

00:40:04.485 --> 00:40:05.778
Ahh!!

00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:08.072
Did it do it?

00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:15.496
It's not working!

00:40:15.997 --> 00:40:18.166
Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:20.001
Shikishima! Machine gun!

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:21.210
Yes!

00:40:29.344 --> 00:40:30.219
Shikishima!

00:40:40.063 --> 00:40:41.189
Ah... ah...

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:43.274
No good! It's useless!

00:40:47.195 --> 00:40:50.448
Inside it's mouth! How about inside it's mouth!

00:40:52.367 --> 00:40:54.077
Reel it in, reel it in!

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.663
Reel, reel, reel, reel!

00:40:56.746 --> 00:40:57.830
Drop it!

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:07.590
Mizushima, ignition!

00:41:07.674 --> 00:41:08.508
Yes!

00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:11.386
Eh?

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:18.601
Eh?

00:41:18.685 --> 00:41:19.894
No way...

00:41:20.687 --> 00:41:21.562
No way!

00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:30.905
Ah?!

00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:36.035
Get down!

00:41:50.591 --> 00:41:51.426
Ahh!!

00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:00.601
Did we kill it?

00:42:07.567 --> 00:42:09.610
No!

00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:22.957
Ah... ah... ahh...

00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:36.596
The Takao!

00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:37.722
Ahh, just in time.

00:43:05.792 --> 00:43:07.251
Crap...

00:43:27.939 --> 00:43:29.774
Can you shoot it again?

00:43:44.831 --> 00:43:46.290
Did they do it?

00:43:57.385 --> 00:43:58.219
What's that?

00:44:05.852 --> 00:44:06.769
Ah...

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.740
Have you finally woken up?

00:45:03.034 --> 00:45:03.993
Where am I?

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:06.412
This is the Yokosuka Hospital.

00:45:06.495 --> 00:45:08.164
You were immediately transported here after words.

00:45:08.664 --> 00:45:12.710
Ah... What about the people abord the Kaishinmaru and Takao?

00:45:18.174 --> 00:45:20.092
Godzilla...

00:45:21.302 --> 00:45:23.971
I see. Where did it go?

00:45:24.055 --> 00:45:26.641
It's whereabouts are unknown.

00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:28.768
Godzilla was heading towards Tōkyō.

00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:30.937
If we don't hurry and issue the evacuation orders,
something bad will happen.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.565
The government will be hiding this information from the public.

00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:36.901
Why aren't they letting everyone know immediately?

00:45:36.984 --> 00:45:39.737
Likely due to the fear of causing confusion.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.948
Now isn't the time to say things like that!

00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:43.699
If we don't evacuate, terrible things will happen...

00:45:43.783 --> 00:45:48.663
Nobody wants to be held responsible for the chaos
that will inevitably be caused.

00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:51.582
Information control is this country's specialty.

00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:02.635
What on earth happened?

00:46:04.178 --> 00:46:06.889
It has nothing to do with you, Noriko-san.

00:46:08.975 --> 00:46:11.519
What's bothering you so much, Shikishima-san?

00:46:14.146 --> 00:46:18.025
With your help, we've been living together to this day.

00:46:18.818 --> 00:46:22.530
And yet I have no part of your life whatsoever?

00:46:29.954 --> 00:46:35.710
If you're carrying a burden, I'd like you to share it with me.

00:46:47.763 --> 00:46:48.764
I'm...

00:46:51.142 --> 00:46:52.143
I'm...

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.738
...one of the suicide attackers...

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:09.827
...who ran away.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.455
Eh?

00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:25.217
On the day of the attack, I pretended that
my plane was malfunction and landed...

00:47:25.217 --> 00:47:26.886
...at a landing site on Ōdo Island.

00:47:40.232 --> 00:47:41.067
These...

00:47:42.985 --> 00:47:46.655
belonged to the maintenance crew there.

00:47:49.617 --> 00:47:52.286
All of them died.

00:48:06.675 --> 00:48:12.681
On that night, a giant dinosaur-like monster appeared.

00:48:16.644 --> 00:48:21.440
They asked me to shoot it down with the machine gun
from a Fighter Zero.

00:48:24.527 --> 00:48:25.528
But I...

00:48:31.242 --> 00:48:32.868
I ran away again.

00:48:34.703 --> 00:48:40.709
As a result, all of them were killed by the monster.

00:48:40.793 --> 00:48:43.212
They all have should been able to see their families!

00:48:48.384 --> 00:48:54.056
The monster was called "Godzilla."

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:01.730
And it appeared again.

00:49:04.567 --> 00:49:05.985
But...

00:49:08.737 --> 00:49:10.739
Once again, I couldn't do anything.

00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:26.005
I'm really a person who doesn't deserve
to be alive!

00:49:33.012 --> 00:49:34.013
Kou-san...

00:49:36.682 --> 00:49:40.853
Survivors are supposed to live proper lives.

00:49:40.936 --> 00:49:42.813
What do you understand, Noriko-san?!

00:49:42.897 --> 00:49:43.981
I understand!

00:49:45.107 --> 00:49:48.777
My parents said "Live!" to me as they were being
burned inside of the fire.

00:49:49.862 --> 00:49:53.699
So because of that, no matter what, I cannot die!

00:49:55.284 --> 00:49:56.577
That's what I've been feeling.

00:50:09.423 --> 00:50:10.674
It's impossible.

00:50:13.636 --> 00:50:17.431
Every night, every night, I have dreams about them!

00:50:17.973 --> 00:50:19.850
"Come up here quickly," they say.

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:24.104
"How are you living your life so proudly?"

00:50:24.188 --> 00:50:28.484
Those are dreams; just illusions created by you, Kou-san.

00:50:28.567 --> 00:50:30.027
First of all... first of all...

00:50:31.654 --> 00:50:34.156
Am I even alive?

00:50:36.617 --> 00:50:38.619
I died on that island a long time ago...

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:40.454
Decaying...

00:50:41.455 --> 00:50:47.795
Noriko-san and Akiko are looking at the corpse...

00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:50.339
That's definently! it!

00:50:50.422 --> 00:50:52.132
You are alive!

00:50:56.554 --> 00:50:58.556
Kou-san is alive!

00:51:02.685 --> 00:51:03.852
Don't you understand?

00:51:18.117 --> 00:51:20.828
Yes, hold the spoon.

00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:24.456
Yes, gently, gently.

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.166
Wait, wait...

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:27.251
Hm?

00:51:28.043 --> 00:51:30.004
Yes, now stir the miso soup.

00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:31.005
Yep.

00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:32.840
Good, good.

00:51:33.465 --> 00:51:35.426
Yes, we did it!

00:51:35.509 --> 00:51:36.343
Yep!

00:51:37.636 --> 00:51:40.180
Raddish. Akiko's favorite raddish.

00:51:40.264 --> 00:51:41.181
Raddish.

00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:42.474
Please give it a taste.

00:51:42.558 --> 00:51:43.392
Yes.

00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:44.810
Yes, please.

00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:48.647
Drink the soup...

00:51:48.731 --> 00:51:49.732
Yes, the raddish.

00:51:51.442 --> 00:51:52.484
Delicious.

00:51:52.568 --> 00:51:54.528
Hot? Is it hot?

00:51:54.612 --> 00:51:55.696
Yep!

00:51:56.822 --> 00:51:58.741
Hey, aren't the raddishes delicious?

00:51:58.824 --> 00:52:00.951
Yep, delicious!

00:52:02.536 --> 00:52:03.537
More!

00:52:05.831 --> 00:52:07.708
Is it okay if we end this?

00:52:14.923 --> 00:52:16.842
I'd like to live again.

00:52:35.944 --> 00:52:38.530
Is this an example of...

00:52:39.615 --> 00:52:41.617
Hurry up and report it!

00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:43.619
Hurry!

00:52:44.119 --> 00:52:45.120
Yes!

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:10.979
A costal defense ship from offshore partrol has reported
a giant creature heading towards Tōkyō bay!

00:53:11.063 --> 00:53:12.898
So, it'll be here soon, won't it?

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:15.651
What's up?

00:53:15.734 --> 00:53:17.069
Is this even possible?

00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:18.278
Is it here?

00:53:18.862 --> 00:53:21.156
Is this really a living thing?

00:53:23.742 --> 00:53:28.747
Tōkyō Bay Defense Line, should we blow up the 4th district
to stop the unidentified creature from intruding?

00:53:29.289 --> 00:53:31.208
Just a little bit more.

00:53:35.379 --> 00:53:37.089
It will soon enter the 4th district!

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:38.924
Now!

00:53:39.007 --> 00:53:40.300
Detonate it!

00:53:42.761 --> 00:53:43.595
Did we do it?

00:53:44.847 --> 00:53:45.681
No good.

00:53:45.764 --> 00:53:47.391
It didn't seem to work.

00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:51.437
The blockade of Tōkyō Bay is a failure! The monster
is now heading towards Shinagawa

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.856
It's extremely big!

00:53:59.361 --> 00:54:00.904
Tha- thanks.

00:54:13.333 --> 00:54:17.212
Breaking news, breaking news!

00:54:17.296 --> 00:54:21.759
A giant creature in the Tōkyō Bay is heading towards Ginza.

00:54:21.842 --> 00:54:26.472
If you are in Ginza, please follow instructions from
the police and begin evacuating immediately.

00:54:27.139 --> 00:54:28.015
This is real.

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:29.349
Ginza...

00:54:36.732 --> 00:54:38.650
Are you injured? Are you okay? Over here!

00:55:12.059 --> 00:55:13.101
Ah...

00:55:13.185 --> 00:55:14.186
Hey, what is that?

00:55:14.269 --> 00:55:15.562
- What happened?
- What's up?

00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:34.790
That's...

00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:36.750
...Godzilla?

00:55:59.481 --> 00:56:01.149
Woah!

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.868
Ah...

00:56:12.035 --> 00:56:14.955
Ah... Ah... Ah...

00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:27.175
Ahh...

00:56:34.474 --> 00:56:36.476
Ah... Ah...

00:56:54.828 --> 00:56:57.331
An unbelievable sight is unfolding!

00:56:57.414 --> 00:57:03.128
An incredibly large creature is rampaging
through Ginza!

00:57:04.212 --> 00:57:07.215
The Nichigeki is beying destroyed right now.

00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:14.097
All those memories and plays, the Nichigeki...
that Nippon Gekijō is now crumbling before our eyes!

00:57:15.057 --> 00:57:17.309
Ah, what a thing to say!

00:57:17.392 --> 00:57:20.270
The town of Ginza, which survived the air rads
from the last war,

00:57:20.354 --> 00:57:22.606
is now reduced to a pile of rubble!

00:57:22.689 --> 00:57:26.443
Ah, what? The monster is approaching this
direction.

00:57:26.526 --> 00:57:31.782
Right now, the face of a giant monster is passing before
our very eyes.

00:57:32.366 --> 00:57:34.660
It has become very dangerous here as well.

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:38.080
Woah!

00:57:47.923 --> 00:57:49.049
Hurry and run away!

00:57:58.600 --> 00:57:59.476
You're in the way!

00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:09.820
Stand up!

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.365
- Kou-san!
- It's no good if you die, hurry!

00:58:55.907 --> 00:58:58.618
- Oh!
- We did it!

00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:01.496
- Ahhh...
- Ah?

00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:42.871
This is...

00:59:44.081 --> 00:59:45.248
...the same as that time.

01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:40.303
Noriko?

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:43.890
Noriko?

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.061
No... Nori... ko...

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:50.897
Ah..

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.986
Ah... Ahh.. Ahh..

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:04.911
Ahh... Ahh...

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:11.978
Ah!

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:13.480
Ahhh!!

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:23.073
AHHHHHHHHH!!!

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:33.625
The damaged caused by the creature is estimated to be around
30,000 killed and injured and over 20,000 buildings destroyed.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:36.836
Rescue efforts have been going on since the disaster.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:42.342
It seems to be difficult to trace the creature due to
the possible risk of radiation.

01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:51.977
In addition, around various places in Ginza,
what seems to be flesh from the giant creature has been found and
the police are working night and day to dispose of it.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.229
The center of Ginza is sealed off.

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:18.211
What will Akiko do now that things have turned out
so badly?

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:19.629
Hm?

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:22.924
When we're in trouble, we help each other out.

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:24.843
Aki-chan.

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:28.888
Hey.

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:33.018
When your otō-chan isn't around, you like to
come over to your oba-chan's, right?

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.562
Where's okaa-chan?

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:42.944
Okaa-chan...

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:49.492
She's away on a trip for work,
so you'll be with your oba-chan for a while.

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:05.091
Hey, Aki-chan. Aki-chan!

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:11.848
Are you okay?

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:39.751
So you're not going to forgive me?

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:47.717
It's because...

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.638
I had a stupid dream.

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:07.654
Shiki-san...

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:15.036
A secret operation to defeat Godzilla is actually underway.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.289
It's a very unsettling...

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:21.751
...civillian-led initiative but...

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.464
Would you like to participate in it?

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.774
Everyone here is...

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:47.360
Yes, formerly a marine.

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:48.445
You know a lot.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:13.136
I'm Hotta, the former captain of the Yukikaze.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:15.680
As you all know,

01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:19.601
Right now, Tōkyō was attacked by a giant and
mysterious creature,

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:21.603
causing an unprecedented crisis.

01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:26.774
However, we do not have a military to protect the
citizens of this country.

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:34.699
It was determined that military action from GHQ would be highly
unlikely due to the risk of provoking the Soviet forces on the continent.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:41.623
This means that we must face that monster with
civillian power alone.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.919
It is for that purpose that we have gathered you all here.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:52.884
As a result of negotiations, they have promised to provide
4 destroyers that were going to be given to the allies, but they...

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:55.887
Are you...

01:06:56.888 --> 01:06:58.932
...telling us that we have to go on a ship again?

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:01.309
I saw that in Ginza.

01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:03.728
I can't beat that type of thing.

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:06.231
After all, disarmed ships

01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:07.899
can't fight back properly!

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:09.943
Yeah! How are we supposed to fight?

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:13.488
Eh... well regarding those matters, please
allow me to explain to you.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:15.281
Noda-san?

01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:18.493
This time...

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:21.454
Sorry about that...

01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:24.457
This time, the person who devised the plan...

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:27.544
...is me, former Navy technical officer Noda Kenji.

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:29.629
First of all,

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:34.300
Eh, according to the legend from Ōdo Island, this
monster is called Godzilla.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:38.930
Godzilla takes almost no damage from normal firemarms.

01:07:39.013 --> 01:07:40.306
I saw it right before my eyes...

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:44.310
It even got hit by the main gun of Heavy Cruiser
Takao, but...

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.312
...it quickly regenerated.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.358
So in secret,

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:53.236
I came up with another solution.

01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:57.824
First, I'm going to show you a simple experiment.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:01.661
The water in here is salt water with the same
concentration as seawater.

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:06.833
This Godzilla-like wood has a weight attached to it
so that it just barely floats.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.544
In this state, if we pumped freon gas through
the tube,

01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:11.754
what will happen if it covers the piece of wood
with bubbles?

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:13.631
What will happen?

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:15.925
Whether or not bubbles comes out, it'll still float, right?

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:18.553
Yeah, that's obvious.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:19.971
That's what you'd think, right?

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:29.480
It sunk! It sunk!

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:32.567
The bubbles from the the freon gas enclose the wood

01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:34.944
and prevent it from coming in contact with the seawater.

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:40.491
My plan is that this time, we use this on Godzilla, the monster
that attacked Tōkyō, and sink him to the bottom of the sea.

01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:44.954
Hey, the Acedemic is a surprisingly awesome guy, isn't he?

01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:45.872
Yep!

01:08:59.052 --> 01:09:03.640
As you know, Sagami Trench off of the coast is more than
1500 meters deep...

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:06.225
...boasting an exceptional depth for waters off the coast.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:10.188
Our current plan is to attach a large number of freon
gas tanks to Godzilla,

01:09:10.271 --> 01:09:13.733
and have them all foam at the same time, covering it
with a curtain of bubbles.

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:18.529
Within a short period of time, it will sink into
Sagami Trench and the pressure will kill it.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:24.160
We'll kill Godzilla with the power of the ocean.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:28.706
This is the outline of Operation Wadatsumi.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.084
That thing came from the see.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.753
It isn't bothered by the deep water pressure.

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:41.719
According to my calculations, after about 25 seconds,
1500 tons will be exerted per square meter.

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:44.097
Even creatures that can normally survive in the deep sea

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.100
cannot with stand these types of rapid pressure changes.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.059
And...

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:51.437
Can you absolutely kill Godzilla?

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:57.235
There are so many things about Godzilla's ecology
that we don't know about...

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:59.445
So we can only create countermeasures against it
based on our predictions.

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:02.365
That's bullcrap, isn't it?

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:06.077
However, since artillery fire is ineffective, this
is the best solution.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.329
Can you kill him? Or can you not?

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:13.292
I can't say for sure.

01:10:15.837 --> 01:10:16.671
Shikishima

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:18.673
There is a possibility!

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:24.929
Shiki-san!

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:28.099
Listen until the end!

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:48.077
Now, for a detailed explanation,

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:57.044
We use 2 destroyers to wrap the cable around Godzilla.

01:10:58.045 --> 01:11:03.760
The cable is already equipped with a large amount
of freon gas tanks.

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:09.474
As soon as it's wrapped around Godzilla, all of the gas
releases,

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:14.812
and Godzilla is pulled down 1500 meters into the deep sea.

01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:16.481
However, if that doesn't work,

01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:18.149
we have a backup plan.

01:11:19.484 --> 01:11:22.403
Everyone, please look at the courtyard.

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:41.589
Deploy!

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:45.051
Oh!

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.386
Awesome! Awesome!

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:50.139
I'm Itagaki from Tōyō Baloon.

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:57.814
What you just saw is an inflatable floatationd device
inspired by the ones installed on former Naval aircraft.

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:03.110
This so-called floating bag gains buoyancy by having
Carbon Dioxide blow into the air sacs.

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:10.451
Now, this can bring Godzilla, who will have reached the bottom
of the ocean, all the way back up to the surface.

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:15.122
Even if it is able to withstand the high pressure,
I don't think it will be able to withstand the

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:17.166
massive decompression that will follow it.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:21.546
Of course, I cannot say for sure that we will
defeat it.

01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:24.006
But the only thing we can do now is what we can.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.514
To all those who survived the war,

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:39.689
I am sorry to ask you to take on a life-threatening
mission again, but I want you to understand.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:43.442
Now that neither the US nor Japanese government can
help us out,

01:12:44.151 --> 01:12:47.196
we are the only ones who can shape the
future for this country.

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:51.659
It's impossible.

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:55.454
I have a family.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:58.416
I just can't do it. That goes for most of
the people here.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:02.920
Why are we the only ones drawing the
short straws?

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.757
I don't want this to be like the war.

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:14.223
Quiet down.

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:17.059
Everyone, I want you to listen carefully.

01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:19.729
This is not an order.

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:23.316
Those with personal situations are free to leave.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:27.361
We have no right to stop you from doing so.

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:52.637
This...

01:13:54.305 --> 01:13:56.307
We're not going to die for sure, right?

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:58.726
Of course not!

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:04.148
Well, then it's much better than wartime!

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:07.234
Yeah, for sure!

01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:09.111
Someone has to do it...

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:11.948
So I guess there's no other way, right?

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:14.325
Without us, the ships won't be able to move.

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:16.786
- That's right!
- I know, right!

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:19.580
All right! Let's do it!

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:23.125
- Let's do it!
- All right!

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:30.091
Everyone...

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:33.719
Thank you.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.013
Let's do it!

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:44.897
But...

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:48.109
I still can't believe you're the one who
planned this type of operation.

01:14:48.192 --> 01:14:51.779
I've encountered Godzilla in real life.

01:14:51.862 --> 01:14:54.532
So, that's why they gave me the green light.

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:58.077
So they called us in for the same reason,
didn't they?

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.080
Do you think it'll return?

01:15:01.872 --> 01:15:05.584
Due to just recently landing in Tōkyō,

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:08.671
you can see it as an addition to Godzilla's
territory.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:09.964
Worst case scenario...

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:13.801
Godzilla appears again sometime within the
next 10 days.

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:15.136
That's early!

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:18.139
Apparently, they've placed lots of
radition-detecting buoys.

01:15:18.222 --> 01:15:21.058
We can't soley rely on our eyes to detect it.

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:23.394
First off, if you set a trap for it,

01:15:23.477 --> 01:15:25.563
you're expecting it to come up and say
"Hai, how old are you?"

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:27.189
That's it.

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:28.357
Hey, that's impossible.

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:32.319
Please don't make fun of me. I'm thinking about
it carefully.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:37.575
There's an underwater loudspeaker that's used
for acoustic minesweeping.

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:39.076
Using that,

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.371
we'll play back the recorded of the sound of
Godzilla from his most recent appearance.

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:43.539
The sound of Godzilla?

01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:44.498
Eh.

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:48.711
Godzilla will chase after another being because he will
feel that his territory is being invaded...

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:50.087
At least he should...

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:51.589
"Should?"

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:53.466
It's always "should."

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.635
And what is that levitation-floating-device-thing for
in the first place?

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:59.513
I don't feel like it's gonna work.

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:01.849
Well then, what are you saying I should do?

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:05.227
Yes, yes, how about we use a destroyer to pull it
back up?

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:08.439
Don't say stupid things. Godzilla is estimated to
weigh around 20,000 tons.

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:10.733
The thrust of only 2 destroyers just isn't enough.

01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:12.777
Ah...

01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:17.239
Well basically, your plan is full of holes.

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:21.952
If you're going to say those types of things, then
please provide an alternative plan.

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:25.414
Noda-san.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:30.586
Do you have any connections to fighter jets somewhere?

01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:32.588
Fighter jets?

01:16:32.671 --> 01:16:34.799
In the unlikely even it does appear on land,

01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:37.426
we can anger him with gunfire and lure it
back to Sagami Bay.

01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:40.971
After they were disarmed, all of them were burned
down, the Japanese fighter jets.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:45.309
Even if there were some left, it
breathes Heat Rays.

01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:48.229
Guiding it with an aircraft would be a
very dangerous job.

01:16:48.312 --> 01:16:50.314
I don't care if it's dangerous.

01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:54.068
Fighter jets are much more mobile than ships anyways.

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:57.071
Are you aiming to get shot down on purpose?

01:16:57.154 --> 01:17:00.449
Are you just desperate?

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:02.952
Are you drunk?!

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:05.996
You just want to avenge Nori-chan.

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:08.249
And you've got a problem with that, don't you?

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:10.292
Now that...

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:16.173
Why didn't you take Nori-chan as your wife before
all this happened?

01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:18.050
You knew how she felt about it, didn't you?

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:20.886
I wanted to do that too!

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:23.973
So why?

01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:27.101
My...

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:36.026
war hasn't ended.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:02.970
There were fighter jets?

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:05.890
Yep, but it's a very special one...

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:30.247
It's the Shinden, a local fighter jet designed
near the end of the war.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.959
Specially designed for hit-and-run bombing attacks.

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:36.045
The maximum speed is over 400 knots.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:39.423
It has a canard design and is equipped with
four 30mm guns.

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:45.387
It's an innovative aircraft that boasts exceptionally
weaponary and incorporates many new inventions.

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:49.934
Apparently, only a few prototypes were ever
deployed in combat.

01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:56.857
They were deployed here for the final battle on the mainland,
but were forgotten about in the confussion after the war...

01:18:57.608 --> 01:19:01.570
Since it was left unattended for so long,
the aircraft often goes rattle-rattle.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:05.157
I can't fly it like this...

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:06.700
That's the problem.

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:08.327
A good mechanic...

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:12.331
No, a person capable of reparing this aircraft is
what we need.

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:18.462
I have a person in mind.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:25.511
Former Ōdo Island Mechanic Tachibana Sōsaku-san?

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:26.512
Yes.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:29.390
Tachibana, Tachibana, Tachibana, Tachibana...

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:33.227
Ah, he currently doesn't have an address registered.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:34.228
I see.

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:37.439
We get tons of requests to search for people
every day.

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:39.692
It'll take a while for us to find him.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:42.611
I need to get in touch with him about some
very urgent matters!

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:45.572
You're in a difficult situation. Even if you say that...

01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:47.700
Please! Just do it!

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:50.119
The survival of the country depends on it!

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:53.580
Even if that's true, I can't do what's not possible.

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:54.498
I'm sorry.

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:55.916
Well then...

01:19:56.750 --> 01:20:01.422
Do you know which unit Tachibana belonged to before
he switched over to Ōdo Island?

01:20:08.887 --> 01:20:11.140
I'm doing all that I can...

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:15.394
But I can't seem to get in touch with that Tachibana-san.

01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:19.315
There are many other excellent former maintenance personnel.

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:21.358
Why don't you just try a different one?

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:23.110
Please give me a little more time.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.114
Why are you so obsessed with that person?

01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:29.283
There's no telling when Godzilla will return.

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:31.285
It's no good if it's not Tachibana!

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:34.288
He's gonna recieve my message soon.

01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:36.874
Please!

01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:05.277
Ta... Tachibana...

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:09.239
Tachibana-san! It's you, Tachibana-san, isn't it!

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:16.038
What's your intention with this?

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:20.793
Ah!

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:27.758
You're saying all the deaths on Ōdo Island were
my fault?

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:31.428
What's up with that?

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:33.263
Sorry...

01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:39.269
I knew that if I said that, you'd get angry
and come over here.

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:40.813
You shameless person!

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:45.651
That thing that attacked Ginza...

01:21:46.693 --> 01:21:47.694
was...

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:50.864
Godzilla from Ōdo Island.

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:02.876
Our fighter jets need to be upgraded...

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.795
...so that I can defeat it!

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:10.384
I really needed to meet up with you so that I
could ask you do do that.

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:13.512
That's why the bullcrap letters.

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:16.849
Please forgive me!

01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:24.106
Do whatever you want.

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:27.317
There's no way I'm gonna give you a hand.

01:22:28.318 --> 01:22:31.238
Tachibana-san! Please wait, Tachibana-san!

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.949
Please wait for a second! Tachibana-san!

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:36.410
There's something I'd like for you to do.

01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:40.164
This is something that only you can do, Tachibana-san.

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:44.668
I once detonated a mine inside of Godzilla's mouth.

01:22:44.751 --> 01:22:46.628
It was far more effective than the guns on the Takao.

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:49.631
He's weak to attacks from the inside. Do you understand?

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:53.218
You...

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:57.890
I'm going to take a fighter jet full of bombs and
fly it into that thing's mouth.

01:22:57.973 --> 01:22:59.892
That will definently kill it!

01:23:06.857 --> 01:23:08.025
A suicide attack?

01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:17.326
Your war isn't over either.

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:23.665
Ah, so you fell down?

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:24.583
Ow!

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:27.377
It's swelling up again pretty badly.

01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:31.381
It's a little embarrassing since I was drunk.

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:33.509
I don't really remember what happened.

01:23:33.592 --> 01:23:36.220
Well, it's no wonder you were so excited after
finding Tachibana-san, who you were

01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:38.764
very particular about wanting.

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:41.975
A canard aircraft?

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:45.604
I heard rumors about it, it actually was built?

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:49.066
Tachibana-san.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:52.236
Everyone, thank you for coming!

01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:54.321
Are you Tachibana-san?

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:01.828
Is this the legendary local fighter jet Shinden?

01:24:01.912 --> 01:24:05.249
Yes. Can you fix it so we can fly it?

01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:11.004
We'll try everything we can.

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:12.756
Thank you.

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:16.426
Thank you. Thank you.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:35.946
What's wrong?

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:39.533
If the planner-sama makes a face like that,
it's bad for morale.

01:24:40.033 --> 01:24:41.952
I proposed this, but...

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:46.331
I started to feel like it would be a miracle
if the operation succeeds.

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:47.749
Even so...

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:50.836
The miracle won't happen if you don't
do anything.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.379
That's true, isn't it?

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:55.924
And look at their faces.

01:24:57.676 --> 01:24:59.553
They aren't idiots.

01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:02.931
They know well that this is a tough
operation that risks their lives.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.600
Even so...

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:10.314
Everyone looks so happy.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:14.026
Maybe this time, they can be helpful.

01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:17.446
Be helpful...

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:21.700
We all survived the war.

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:25.954
That's why I said, "this time."

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:42.179
Hurry up!

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.392
Please make room.

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:56.151
1 hour ago, off of the East Coast of
Hacijō Island at 33°10'N 140°01'E,

01:25:56.234 --> 01:25:59.780
It was reported that the installed Geiger counters
had detected a reaction.

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:03.867
And then here and here.

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:20.926
Godzilla's approaching.

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:23.261
At last.

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:25.430
Reverse-calculating from this speed,

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:29.810
Godzilla will arrive at the trench off the
coast of Sagami Bay at 1100 hours.

01:26:29.893 --> 01:26:31.436
In order to confront it,

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.232
we will depart tomorrow morning at 0800 hours.

01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:37.567
All right!

01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:38.527
However...

01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:41.488
Will the device be completed by then?

01:26:42.906 --> 01:26:44.866
Please take us with you.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:47.411
The 3 hours it takes to get to the site are precious.

01:26:47.494 --> 01:26:49.246
As an engineer, I want it to be perfect.

01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:52.916
But you might get caught up in the fight
with Godzilla.

01:26:53.917 --> 01:26:55.752
We all came back from the war too.

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:04.928
Everyone, if possible,

01:27:05.011 --> 01:27:08.849
please go home and spend time with your
families tonight.

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:11.893
Are you saying to be prepared?

01:27:17.107 --> 01:27:18.400
If you think about it...

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:23.989
If you think about it, this country has wasted
too many lives.

01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:27.200
Tanks with vulnerable armor...

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:34.166
Due to negligance of supplies, most battlefield
deaths are due to starvation or disease...

01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:40.589
The fighter jets didn't even have basic
escape methods,

01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:46.344
in the end being suicide attacks and gyokusai...

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:49.973
So this time...

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:59.483
I want to be proud of this civillian-led operation for
not having a single casualty.

01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:06.281
This time, the battle is not a fight to the death.

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:10.118
It's a fight to live in the future.

01:28:12.704 --> 01:28:14.456
All right... all right...

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:15.957
Let's do it!

01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:19.377
All right! Let's do it!

01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:26.510
It's finally happening tomorrow. I'm trembling
with excitement!

01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:28.136
You're not coming with us.

01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:31.556
What do you mean?

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:35.018
Well, those hands aren't going to do you any good.

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:37.562
Shikishima's going too, right?

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:39.940
Is it because I don't have any experience with war?

01:28:40.023 --> 01:28:42.192
Do you really think I'm useless?

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:48.156
Kid, you're lucky that you didn't go to war.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.915
I want to protect this country too!

01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:02.420
Why can't I come with you?

01:29:04.881 --> 01:29:07.884
We've been together for a while now!

01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:10.720
Please!

01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:13.515
Please take me with you too!

01:29:14.224 --> 01:29:16.059
I want to go with you too!

01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:18.728
I leave this country to you.

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:20.522
Captain!

01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:22.065
Noda-san!

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:36.288
Lower it a bit... carefully...

01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:55.515
See you, Aki-chan.

01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:05.108
Ah...

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:08.862
Thank you for everything.

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:26.171
Akiko. Did you have fun at oba-chan's house?

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:27.672
It was fun.

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:30.133
I see. That's good.

01:30:34.721 --> 01:30:36.014
Are you giving that to me?

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:38.850
Thanks.

01:30:44.648 --> 01:30:45.815
Akiko.

01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:46.858
Hmm?

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:51.071
Is this me, okaa-chan, and you, Akiko?

01:30:52.405 --> 01:30:54.574
Okaa's in it, too.

01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:56.785
I see.

01:30:58.411 --> 01:30:59.788
You drew it well.

01:31:10.757 --> 01:31:12.842
Why are you making that face?

01:31:17.597 --> 01:31:19.015
What's wrong?

01:31:19.516 --> 01:31:20.558
Akiko.

01:31:21.559 --> 01:31:23.436
Hey, hey!

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:30.402
Hey, it's okay! I'm not going anywhere...

01:32:46.978 --> 01:32:48.271
Tachibana san.

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:51.316
Can you deploy it?

01:32:54.277 --> 01:32:56.279
I'll get it ready now.

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:09.751
The ordered bomb.

01:33:11.336 --> 01:33:15.590
Two machine guns, 140 kilograms; 120 rounds,
80 kilograms, and...

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.468
One of the main fuel tanks, 400 kilograms,
were removed.

01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:23.848
Instead, this plane was fitted with a No. 25 bomb in
the nose and a No. 50 bomb in the fuselage.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:28.103
Now, I can finally repay my debt.

01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:43.827
That's hilarious...

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:50.542
I feel like I want to live.

01:33:55.338 --> 01:33:57.799
Those who died that day felt like that too.

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:00.844
Everyone wanted to come back alive.

01:34:02.512 --> 01:34:07.851
But their wishes weren't granted. They were
killed like insects.

01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:11.229
I understand.

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.880
The kid who drew this is named "Akiko."

01:34:38.882 --> 01:34:40.884
I want you to protect her future.

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:48.892
I'll kill absolutely Godzilla, even if
it means I have to kill myself.

01:34:49.893 --> 01:34:51.978
It seems like you finally made up your mind.

01:34:54.314 --> 01:34:57.942
All right then, I'm gonna tell you something important.

01:34:58.860 --> 01:34:59.861
Look.

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:03.198
This is the bomb's safety device.

01:35:03.907 --> 01:35:05.700
Pull it out right before you plunge into him.

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:06.701
Okay?

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:10.163
And...

01:35:19.464 --> 01:35:21.466
Aki-chan.

01:35:23.843 --> 01:35:26.429
What's wrong? Are you lonely?

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:28.556
Here.

01:35:35.605 --> 01:35:37.231
"To Sumiko-san"

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:03.883
Otō-chan...

01:36:05.009 --> 01:36:06.552
Hmm? Otō-chan?

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:08.721
Otō-chan...

01:36:09.555 --> 01:36:11.516
It's okay, it's okay.

01:36:29.158 --> 01:36:33.663
This is Kuroshio 12, 35°03'N, 139°41'E.

01:36:33.746 --> 01:36:35.456
A large amount of deep-sea fish emerging have
been spotted!

01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:57.103
Godzilla spotted in Sagami Bay!

01:36:57.186 --> 01:37:03.359
Currently, we are attempting to use an underwater
loudspeaker unit to guide it to the area of the operation.

01:37:03.443 --> 01:37:05.236
Advance schedule for each ship!
Only take essential items with you!

01:37:06.946 --> 01:37:08.364
Let's hurry up and board the ship!

01:37:08.448 --> 01:37:09.532
Let's hurry!

01:37:12.076 --> 01:37:13.870
Looks like Mizushima-kun gave up, didn't he?

01:37:13.953 --> 01:37:15.538
I feel bad for him, but it can't be helped.

01:37:15.621 --> 01:37:18.333
I actually don't want Shiki-san to
fly either.

01:37:18.416 --> 01:37:21.044
Isn't Shiki-san a suicide attack survivor?

01:37:21.127 --> 01:37:22.086
Seems impossible.

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:25.298
Akiko is here. He'll definently come back.

01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:38.144
Underwater loudspeaker destroyed.

01:37:38.227 --> 01:37:43.566
Godzilla has invaded Sagami Bay. Wadatsumi Squadron,
set sail immediately.

01:37:44.233 --> 01:37:45.360
Hey!

01:37:46.319 --> 01:37:47.487
Over there!!

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:49.572
It's here already?

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:02.960
Godzilla breaks through the final defense zone!

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:04.462
Landing is imminent!

01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:06.130
I'm leaving!

01:39:01.436 --> 01:39:03.479
With this, you're going to end it all.

01:39:04.814 --> 01:39:06.190
Shikishima.

01:39:06.274 --> 01:39:08.526
Depart from port immediately.

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:13.364
Repeat, all ships of the Wadatsumi Squadron
are to depart from port immediately.

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:22.790
What should we do? That plan's completely
falling apart!

01:39:22.874 --> 01:39:24.959
Even so, we'll still set sail.

01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:29.672
The missles must be dropped off of the coast of
Sagami Bay, where it will have the greatest effect.

01:39:30.173 --> 01:39:33.426
We have no way but to rely on Shiki-san to
lure it.

01:39:33.509 --> 01:39:34.510
Yes!

01:39:34.594 --> 01:39:36.220
Let's do it!

01:39:51.944 --> 01:39:54.113
Noda-san! It's from Shikishima-san!

01:39:55.781 --> 01:39:58.242
This is Shikishima, takeoff was a success.

01:39:58.326 --> 01:40:00.495
Now guiding Godzilla into the area of
the operation.

01:40:00.578 --> 01:40:02.622
We'll be ready soon too.

01:40:02.705 --> 01:40:03.998
So let's get to the operation area quickly...

01:40:04.081 --> 01:40:06.876
Shikishima! Don't do anything crazy!

01:40:06.959 --> 01:40:09.212
If you leave Akiko all alone, I'll
never forgive you!

01:40:12.465 --> 01:40:14.300
Can you hear me, Shikishima?

01:40:15.927 --> 01:40:17.929
Damn it, he's ignoring me...

01:40:41.202 --> 01:40:43.079
Telegram!

01:40:44.038 --> 01:40:45.039
Yes...

01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:52.588
Yes?

01:40:52.672 --> 01:40:54.173
Are you Shikishima-san?

01:40:56.509 --> 01:40:57.343
It's a telegram.

01:40:57.426 --> 01:40:58.386
Yes.

01:41:59.488 --> 01:42:00.781
Woah!

01:42:21.761 --> 01:42:25.431
Haha! That's a big deal!

01:42:25.931 --> 01:42:29.352
Godzilla's quite pissed off.

01:42:29.435 --> 01:42:30.519
It's in pursuit.

01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:32.647
It's our turn, isn't it?

01:42:35.858 --> 01:42:37.234
All ships, prepare for battle!

01:42:37.318 --> 01:42:39.862
All ships, prepare for battle!

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:43.407
Freon cylinders, all right!

01:42:43.491 --> 01:42:45.159
46cm shells, all right!

01:42:45.242 --> 01:42:46.535
Floatation device switch, all right!

01:42:46.619 --> 01:42:48.162
Concentration cables, all right!

01:42:48.245 --> 01:42:50.539
All circuits connected!

01:42:50.623 --> 01:42:53.376
Confirming power and releasing
the safety switch.

01:43:09.892 --> 01:43:12.353
All right, nice!

01:43:14.063 --> 01:43:15.856
Unit 1, attack as planned.

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:18.234
As planned!

01:43:49.306 --> 01:43:51.058
Nice!

01:44:27.636 --> 01:44:30.347
That's... Godzilla's Heat Ray.

01:44:33.017 --> 01:44:35.311
It's impossible to do this type of thing!

01:44:35.394 --> 01:44:38.314
Captain! I recommend that we immediately
evacutate the ship.

01:44:38.397 --> 01:44:39.690
No. This is good.

01:44:39.774 --> 01:44:41.275
Please start the operation immediately.

01:44:41.358 --> 01:44:43.194
But when will Heat Ray come again?

01:44:43.277 --> 01:44:44.403
As I told you,

01:44:44.487 --> 01:44:47.490
Once the Heat Ray is used, it takes time
to regenerate it.

01:44:48.073 --> 01:44:49.200
Now!

01:44:50.451 --> 01:44:51.660
Please make up your mind!

01:44:57.166 --> 01:44:59.251
Operation Wadatsumi begins!

01:45:17.686 --> 01:45:21.857
Start to deploy the 46cm shells, cylinders,
and floatation device!

01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:48.843
Shiki-san!

01:46:14.785 --> 01:46:15.953
Crane deployed!

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:17.037
Copy that!

01:46:17.872 --> 01:46:19.832
Send to Hibiki, maintain course.

01:46:20.332 --> 01:46:22.626
Hibiki, maintain course.

01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:25.963
I don't mind a little damage, we're going
to maintain this level of speed!

01:46:30.426 --> 01:46:32.928
Hibiki approaching, 4 meters.

01:46:34.013 --> 01:46:35.097
2 meters.

01:46:35.598 --> 01:46:37.182
Brace for impact.

01:46:37.266 --> 01:46:38.726
Brace for impact!

01:46:53.616 --> 01:46:55.618
Cross complete! Full speed ahead!

01:46:55.701 --> 01:46:58.162
Full speed ahead!

01:47:12.927 --> 01:47:15.429
All right! All right!

01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:17.181
Chou-san, switch!

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:18.223
Oh!

01:47:26.607 --> 01:47:28.901
Crap! Already?

01:47:30.110 --> 01:47:31.320
Almost...

01:47:42.081 --> 01:47:43.916
Ready...

01:47:53.509 --> 01:47:54.510
Chou-san, now!

01:47:57.638 --> 01:47:59.264
- Cylinder!
- All right!

01:48:15.906 --> 01:48:18.409
Depth: 1200.

01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:20.494
1300.

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:21.954
1400.

01:48:22.037 --> 01:48:23.163
Go!

01:48:23.247 --> 01:48:24.915
Go!

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:27.626
1500.

01:48:27.710 --> 01:48:30.087
Target depth reached!

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:45.019
Godzilla has gone silent!

01:48:45.102 --> 01:48:46.478
Did we do it?

01:48:54.236 --> 01:48:55.863
Stubborn bastard!

01:48:56.447 --> 01:48:57.781
Moving to the backup plan.

01:48:57.865 --> 01:48:59.033
Do it.

01:49:17.509 --> 01:49:19.261
Come up here!

01:49:19.887 --> 01:49:21.805
Depth: 1200.

01:49:22.306 --> 01:49:24.308
1100, 1000!

01:49:32.858 --> 01:49:34.193
The cables have stopped!

01:49:34.777 --> 01:49:36.904
They stopped at a depth of 803!

01:49:38.489 --> 01:49:40.324
Why? Why did they stop?

01:49:45.037 --> 01:49:46.455
He chewed them all apart.

01:49:49.666 --> 01:49:52.086
To Hibiki! We'll pull from all directions
to lift up Godzilla.

01:49:52.169 --> 01:49:53.754
Full speed ahead at 90 degrees!

01:49:53.837 --> 01:49:56.423
But the thrust of 2 ships isn't enough.

01:49:57.007 --> 01:49:58.550
There's no other options!

01:49:58.634 --> 01:50:00.010
Do everything you can!

01:50:00.636 --> 01:50:01.762
Yes!

01:50:18.362 --> 01:50:21.740
If this continues, the crane won't
be able to hold it anymore!

01:50:21.824 --> 01:50:23.242
It's no good!

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:28.997
Ah...

01:50:45.514 --> 01:50:52.354
This is the Yokohama Tugboat' company's
Fujimaru. We'll do our best to help out.

01:50:52.896 --> 01:50:53.897
That voice...

01:50:54.731 --> 01:50:57.526
It's Mizushima. Are you the captain?

01:50:58.652 --> 01:51:00.821
Kid! It's you?

01:51:01.738 --> 01:51:02.614
Yes!

01:51:02.698 --> 01:51:06.493
This is Koeimaru, another ship from Tōyō Kisen.

01:51:06.577 --> 01:51:10.122
We, the Nikkōmaru from the Yokohama
Tugboat Company, will cooperate.

01:51:10.205 --> 01:51:11.999
Shiokazemaru will assist you.

01:51:12.082 --> 01:51:14.585
- Tetsuyūmaru.
- Nanamimaru.
- Minamimaru.

01:51:14.668 --> 01:51:18.046
きっしょうまる　
- Junseimaru.
- Heimitsumaru.

01:51:18.130 --> 01:51:20.924
- Tenyūmaru.
- Kaiōmaru.
- Yūga.

01:51:21.008 --> 01:51:23.760
- Chōkamaru.
- Jūseimaru.
- Taramaru.
- Yasagamaru.

01:51:23.844 --> 01:51:26.889
Please stop calling me "useless!"

01:51:28.765 --> 01:51:30.017
All right!

01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:31.977
You don't say.

01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:35.063
I'm both surprised and impressed with him.

01:51:35.147 --> 01:51:36.732
Get the tugboats!

01:51:36.815 --> 01:51:38.775
All the ships will pull up Godzilla!

01:51:38.859 --> 01:51:40.652
Get the tugboats

01:51:40.736 --> 01:51:42.696
Get the tugboats!

01:52:07.304 --> 01:52:10.224
The depth has started increasing!

01:52:11.642 --> 01:52:14.728
Come up here, come up here!

01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:17.773
Depth: 700.

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:20.400
Raise, raise, raise...

01:52:51.390 --> 01:52:52.933
It's not damaged enough!

01:52:53.892 --> 01:52:56.061
All ships take evasive action!

01:53:46.903 --> 01:53:48.530
What's he going to do?

01:53:48.613 --> 01:53:49.698
No way!

01:53:53.535 --> 01:53:54.411
That can't be!

01:53:54.494 --> 01:53:57.331
It's no good! Shikishima!

01:54:24.441 --> 01:54:25.442
Shikishima...

01:54:40.791 --> 01:54:42.250
No, that!

01:54:47.130 --> 01:54:48.256
I see...

01:54:49.966 --> 01:54:51.468
I see.

01:54:54.137 --> 01:54:57.599
The crew member escaped safely.

01:55:06.066 --> 01:55:08.652
This seat serves as an escape device.

01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:11.696
Pull that lever to activate it.

01:55:15.409 --> 01:55:16.535
Live.

01:55:19.037 --> 01:55:20.372
Tachibana-san.

01:56:51.046 --> 01:56:52.130
Shikishima!

01:56:57.636 --> 01:56:58.762
You did it!

01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:00.889
You did it!

01:57:02.974 --> 01:57:04.226
Kid!

01:57:08.271 --> 01:57:09.105
Sumiko-san!

01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:10.357
Kōichi-san!

01:57:11.316 --> 01:57:12.526
Kōichi-san...

01:57:12.609 --> 01:57:13.818
Akiko...

01:57:20.325 --> 01:57:21.284
Eh?

01:58:02.993 --> 01:58:04.744
Kou-san, is your war...

01:58:06.955 --> 01:58:08.290
Over?

01:58:21.386 --> 01:58:22.554
Yep.

01:59:24.407 --> 01:59:29.120
