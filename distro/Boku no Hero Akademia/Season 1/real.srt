1
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:07,382
Number 1 hero, All Might.

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,468
Unknown age, unknown quirk.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,015
He suddenly appeared in the hero world and
got unshakable popularity for his abilities.

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,185
After his appearance...

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,356
...the number of severe crimes comitted by
villains decreased each year.

6
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,108
His very existence is considered a deterrent...

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,363
and he's a man who became a symbol of peace
in both his name and reality.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,450
And that man, said to me...

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,579
You can become a hero.

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,289
- Ah? Midoriya?

11
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,542
How the hell could a quirkless
loser like you

12
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,419
be on the same level as I am?!

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,671
You should give up, all right?

14
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,005
I'm sorry, Izuku...

15
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,716
What I wanted to be told...

16
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:54,471
Someone that I admired told me those words.

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:59,017
This type of thing... Is anything as
surprising as this is?

18
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,894
Is anything as...

19
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:06,400
You are worthy of inheiriting my power.

20
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:11,905
Eh?

21
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:17,411
♪～

22
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:41,953
～♪

23
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,125
In... Inheiriting your power?

24
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:53,590
What a face you're making! It's a suggestion.
The real action begins here.

25
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,970
Listen up, shōnen. My power...

26
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,265
Will you accept it?

27
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:07,521
Wh... what the heck are you talking
about, All Might?

28
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,816
I'm talking about my power, shōnen.

29
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,819
In weekly magazines...

30
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,405
they all say it's "superhuman strength"
or "boost."

31
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,243
I've evaded the question on interviews
with jokes.

32
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,538
Because the "Symbol of Peace" All Might...

33
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,332
had to be a naturally-born hero.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,754
However, shōnen, I'll tell you the truth.

35
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:39,636
My quirk is something that is passed
down like a sacred flame.

36
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,640
Something... passed down?

37
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,435
Yes! And now...

38
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,437
it's your turn!

39
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,939
Wa... ho... wa... hold on a second!

40
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,275
Whether All Might's quirk...

41
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,154
...is one of the seven wonders of the world
is a hot topic for debates!

42
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,573
You almost always see it online!

43
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,950
But, ah, inheiriting a quirk...

44
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,618
I don't really understand that...

45
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,204
I've never heard of that type of thing before.

46
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,665
It's not even speculated about in discussions.

47
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,459
That's because, since the dawn of history,

48
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,545
that type of quirk hasn't been confirmed.

49
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,717
You start in denial.

50
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,511
- Nonsense!
- Ah?

51
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,098
I have many secrets, but I don't lie.

52
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:29,686
"The power to transfer power..." That is the
quirk I inheirited.

53
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,650
It was given the name "One For All."

54
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,488
One For All...

55
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,031
Yes.

56
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,743
1 person gains power...

57
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:49,956
...who passes it on to another who
gains power and passes it on again.

58
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:56,797
And so, the voices crying for help and
the brave souls have been woven together.

59
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,465
A crystal of power.

60
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,385
That's so important... Why...

61
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,721
Why would you give that to me?

62
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,641
I was originally looking for a heir,

63
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:12,103
and I thought I could give them to you.

64
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,358
You, an ordinary quirkless hero lover...

65
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,109
more than anyone else at that moment...

66
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:19,986
were a hero.

67
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,244
Just kidding.!

68
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,830
Though, it's just up to you.

69
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:30,956
What do you say?

70
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,709
He told me this much...

71
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,462
Revealing a big secret to me...

72
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,342
Are there? There's none, right?
There aren't any!

73
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,053
There are... no reasons to refuse!

74
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,932
Please!

75
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,517
An immediate answer.

76
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,811
I thought you'd say that.

77
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,315
However, recieving power...

78
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,235
was not something easy.

79
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,456
Hey, hey, hey!

80
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,668
What a comfortable fridge to sit on!

81
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,672
Had it moved even a tiny bit...

82
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,716
it would've been a little more comfortable.

83
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,011
Well,

84
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,097
that's because you weigh 274kg, right, All Might?

85
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,350
No, I lost weight. I'm 255 kilograms...

86
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,727
In this form.

87
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:40,525
By the way, why I am hauling trash around at
a beach park.

88
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,569
That's that.

89
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:44,904
You're not a vessel.

90
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,574
Eh? That's the exact opposite of what
you said earlier!

91
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,119
Your body, it's your body!

92
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,705
Ah?

93
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,791
My quirk, One For All,

94
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,544
is like the ultimate phyiscal
abilities of many people

95
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,463
combined into one.

96
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,633
A weak body can't handle it.

97
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,969
Your limbs would get torn off and explode.

98
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:08,928
Limbs torn off?!

99
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:15,810
So, I'm picking up trash to train my body?

100
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,230
Yes! But that's not all.

101
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,984
I looked it up online. This beach park...

102
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,322
The coastline has been like this for years!

103
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,241
Yeah...

104
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,412
There's lots of floating debris due to the
ocean currents or something...

105
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,166
People take adventage of this, so illegal
dumping is also rampant here.

106
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,418
Even the locals don't come here.

107
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,714
The best heros just pursue flashiness.

108
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,759
But originally, heros were volunteers.

109
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:53,014
Even if people say that it's plain,
we can't waver from that.

110
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,395
You will revive the entire horizon
of this area.

111
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,399
That's your first step in becoming a hero.

112
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,277
My first step...

113
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,280
is cleaning this?

114
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,616
全部？

115
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,869
Midoriya-shōnen, you aspire to go
to U.A., right?

116
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,579
Yes... Yes!

117
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,457
U.A. is the school you went to, All Might,

118
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,838
so if I go, it definently will
be U.A.!

119
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,382
Proactive otaku!

120
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,051
But as I said earlier...

121
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,221
It's not a job you can do
without a quirk.

122
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,765
Sadly, that's the reality.

123
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,269
In addition, U.A. has the most
difficult hero course.

124
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,687
In other words...

125
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:45,275
I have 10 months left before the entrance
exam to finish becoming a vessel.

126
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,402
That leads to this!

127
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,281
My idea: "The Aim-For-Success
American Dream Plan!"

128
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:56,411
It's a training plan to make
cleaning up trash more efficient.

129
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,039
Your entire life will follow this schedule.

130
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,666
Even your bedtime...

131
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,085
Honestly, this is super hard.

132
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,253
Can you keep up with it?

133
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,715
Of course...

134
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,426
I have to work harder than other people,

135
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,969
or I'm no good!

136
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,433
And this is how my 10 months of hell began.

137
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,146
Bring it to the park entrance!

138
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,481
Load it into the truck!

139
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,401
Depending on the shape and size,
completely different muscles are used.

140
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,320
I see, this is...

141
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,113
Run, run!

142
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,823
10 months is just around the corner!

143
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,285
Let's be athletic!

144
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,498
Eh... along with the paranormal,

145
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,750
revisions to the Build Standards Act
are underway...

146
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,711
It's intense... 10 months of this?

147
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,799
It's gonna be tough if I don't finish
it 1 week before the enterence exam,

148
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,427
so I have 294 days left.

149
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,304
Taking muscle recovery into account...

150
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,808
So let's say there's an interval
of about 2 days.

151
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,437
Even if I do it efficiently, the
actual training takes about 98 days.

152
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,524
5 hours of traning, in the morning
and the evening...

153
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,776
490 hours.

154
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,404
Also, cleaning trash isn't about training
specific parts of the body...

155
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,532
I have to train my whole body evenly,

156
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,450
or there's no way I'll make it in time.

157
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,786
Building a body that can adapt
to any situation...

158
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,788
This is the exact type of training I
need to become a hero.

159
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,791
All Might won't always be watching
over me, either...

160
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,463
Midoriya, hey!

161
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,135
Did you damage your head in the
encounter with the villain?

162
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,139
If something like that happened, it's
arrogant for you to even mention U.A.

163
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,307
Plus, preparing for the exam...

164
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,059
Is he going psycho already?

165
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,519
Scary...

166
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:06,819
Sometimes when anything doesn't go well

167
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:11,205
I believe in what I've been working on

168
00:11:12,826 --> 00:11:14,890
Do what you like, just give me one thing

169
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,652
I see the future, don't miss out now

170
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:22,734
Hero is in my heart, hero is in your heart

171
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,873
I don't care whatever people say

172
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,906
I can be a hero, you can be a hero

173
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:34,709
If you wanna make it just try hard
I know I'll be suffice you

174
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,446
Hey, hey, what's wrong? There's
only 3 months left!

175
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,073
You won't make it at all.

176
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,035
Are you gonna quit? Take it
easy today?

177
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,084
Overwork?

178
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,004
The "Aim-to-Pass American Dream plan"

179
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,381
I thought I had adjusted it
to fit your body so you could

180
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,717
complete it in time for the enterance exam...

181
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,471
You aren't sticking to the plan, are you?

182
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:48,142
Overdoing it will only be counter-productive.
Don't you want to pass?

183
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,978
I want to.

184
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,898
But it's just not enough to get it.

185
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:54,857
うん？

186
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,528
I have to work way harder than other people,

187
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,948
otherwise I won't be able to keep up.

188
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,912
I want to be like you!

189
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:12,125
To become the best hero!

190
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,713
Saving people with a fearless smile...

191
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,798
Like you.

192
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,762
He's looking far into the future!

193
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,142
You proactive otaku!

194
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,645
I don't dislike that type of thing.

195
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,274
But if that's the case, you shouldn't
be in a hurry anymore.

196
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,776
But I got the setiment.

197
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,738
Oji-san will adjust the plan a bit.

198
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,033
All Might... isn't oji-san...

199
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,083
So, at 6:00 am on the day of the exam...

200
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,313
Hey, hey, hey...

201
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,940
Even beyond the designated area...

202
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,194
For real? There's not even a speck of dust left...

203
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,362
Is this for real?

204
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:29,827
He more than finished it
at the last minute...

205
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,955
All Mi... All Mig...

206
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,207
Goodness!

207
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,924
Good job!

208
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,679
All Mihgt... I did it...

209
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,348
I did it.

210
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,309
Ah, I'm surprised.

211
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,522
You entertainer! Being a teenager
is wonderful!

212
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,233
- Check this out!

213
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,569
- This is...

214
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,571
- You from 10 months ago.

215
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,119
Good job, really!

216
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,623
The mirage of getting in has just
barely came into view...

217
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,252
But you now are certainly a vessel!

218
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,883
I feel like I'm cheating somehow...

219
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,638
All Might... thank you for helping
me out like this.

220
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,975
You're too kind.

221
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,897
What's the deal now? It's your
own hard work.

222
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,568
You need to fix that crybaby behavior.

223
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:47,405
Now, the award ceremony, Midoriya Izuku!

224
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,781
Yes!

225
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,577
This is something I heard somewhere,

226
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:57,582
It's important to remember that those given something
by chance and those given something by recognition,

227
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:03,129
their essences are different from
each other.

228
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,508
This is the power that you have earned.

229
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,977
A reality more surprising than the comics...

230
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,770
I also grabbed onto one.

231
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,606
Eat it.

232
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,733
Huh?

233
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,945
As long as you intake my DNA, it
doesn't matter what it is.

234
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,573
That's completely different from what
I expected!

235
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,283
Well, there's no time.

236
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,826
You'll be late for the exam!

237
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,161
- Here, here!
- Wah...

238
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,122
- Here!
- Waaaaaaaaaaah!

239
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,637
Just in time.

240
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,852
In the end, I didn't have time to try

241
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,646
the power I got from All Might.

242
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,148
Eat it!

243
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,403
I ate it, but I wonder if it
really worked.

244
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,447
Move, Deku!

245
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,491
Kat-chan!

246
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,202
Don't stand in front of me,
or I'll kill you.

247
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:20,998
Uh... G-good morning, pl-please
try your h-hardest!

248
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,921
Hey, look, isn't that Bakugō? From during the slime?

249
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,130
Wow, it's really him!

250
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:33,135
Since that day, Kat-chan hasn't done
anything to me.

251
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,848
It's already a habit for me to
get scared like this.

252
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,061
I'm different from before.

253
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,524
Remember the past 10 months.

254
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,900
Take...

255
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,737
my first step to becoming a hero!

256
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,157
This...

257
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,329
Are you okay?

258
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,337
It's my quirk.

259
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,839
Sorry for using it without your permission,

260
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,342
but if you fell it would've been
bad luck.

261
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,596
I'm so nervous...

262
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,514
Eh... Ah... Uh...

263
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,767
Please try your best! Bye!

264
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,898
I talked to a girl!

265
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,067
"Didn't Talk"

266
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,290
Exam canidate listeners...

267
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,043
Welcome today to my live!

268
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,670
Everybody say "hey!"

269
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,007
"Silence!!"

270
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,843
You're all chill.

271
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,762
So, to the exam canidate listeners...

272
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,182
I'll give you a quick presentation
of the practical exam.

273
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,643
Are you ready?

274
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,811
Yeah!

275
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,147
"Silence!!"

276
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,067
It's voice hero Present Mic!

277
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,610
Awesome!

278
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,071
I listen to his weekly radio! I'm touched!

279
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,323
All of the instructors at U.A. are
professional heros!

280
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,157
Annoying.

281
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,786
According to the entrance exam guidelines,

282
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:25,498
listeners will participate in a
10-minute mock city excercise!

283
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,125
Feel free to bring anything.

284
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,004
After the presentation, head over to your
designated training venue.

285
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,006
"Silence!!"

286
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,591
Okay?

287
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,011
So in other words, they don't want
friends helping each other out.

288
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,389
Really...

289
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,309
Are exam numbers are consecutive, but we're
in different training venues!

290
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,770
Don't look or I'll kill you!

291
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,315
Tch, I can't crush you.

292
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:57,530
The training grounds have 3 types of
virtual villains deployed.

293
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:01,367
You will earn points based off of each
of their difficulty levels.

294
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,871
Each player incapacitates the virtual villain
with their own quirk

295
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,582
Your goal is to earn points, listeners.

296
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,544
And of course, attacks on others

297
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,296
and anti-hero actions are prohibited.

298
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,091
Can I ask a question?

299
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,634
Okay!

300
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,972
There are 4 types of villains listed
on this printout.

301
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,849
If it's a misprint,

302
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,352
it will be a shameful act for U.A.,
Japan's best school!

303
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,690
We as test takers are sitting here

304
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,734
to seek guidance from examplary heros!

305
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,653
And you with the crazy hair!

306
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,029
Eh?

307
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,783
Your mumbling to yourself is distracting!

308
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,454
If you're just sightseeing, leave here immediately!

309
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,373
Excuse me...

310
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,292
Okay, okay!

311
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,836
Canidate Number 7111-kun.

312
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,589
Nice letter, thank you!

313
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,842
Villains in category 4 are 0 points.

314
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,386
They're pests.

315
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:07,224
They're gimmicks that cause mayhem
throughout each venue.

316
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,728
They're not impossible to beat,
but there's no point in doing so.

317
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,732
Listeners, I recommend you avoid it.

318
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,611
Thank you! I'm sorry!

319
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,033
I see. It's a stage gimmick that can
be avoided.

320
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,951
It's like a game, this is.

321
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,329
That's all from me.

322
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:32,833
Finally, to the listeners, let's present
our school motto.

323
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:37,087
The hero Napoleon Bonaparte said,

324
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,719

00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,649
And everyone, have a good time!

328
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,617
I... I'm doing it...

329
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,411
What All Might trained me to do...

330
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,248
What I achieved in the past 10 months...

331

336
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,401
Using only the quirk I inheirited
from All Might,

337
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,612
can I survive the practical exam?

338
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,697
Let's all do our best on
the enterance exam please!

339

Eh? Who's that?

340
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,369
More like, I talked to a girl!

341
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,371
Next time: "Start Line."
