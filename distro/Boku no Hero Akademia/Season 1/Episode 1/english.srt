1
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,301
That's awful, Kat-chan!

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,511
He's crying!

3
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,723
Any more of this... I... I...

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,725
I won't allow it to go on!

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,438
You're Quirkless...

6
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,859
...yet still trying to be a hero, Deku!

7
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,627
People are, not born equal.

8
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,718
This is the reality of society that I learned as
a weak 4-year-old.

9
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:58,100
And... it was my first and last setback.

10
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,698
Wow!

11
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:15,890
"Midoriya Izuku"

12
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,916
That's a huge villain!

13
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:31,380
At 5 am I held my breath as the silence sunk in

14
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:35,147
Biting my nails on the fire escape,
what will tomorrow bring?

15
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:39,280
The day has come

16
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,430
The never-ending night and the never-ending rain

17
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,464
Are all part of this worthless world

18
00:01:58,464 --> 00:01:59,460
"Become a hero too! - Sidekick Recruitment"

19
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,796
Isn't it a little bit off, my feet are
caught up in a slumber

20
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:08,868
I'm not blaming you

21
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:14,209
Playing alone there in your fantasies

22
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:23,094
Are you even ashamed of what you imagine?

23
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:30,711
A labyrinth, getting tangled inside a labyrinth,
will you still say that you'll go

24
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:35,912
The sound of the starting bell played by
a little traveler

25
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:38,369
Where am I headed? Don't know, don't know

26
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,843
Are you really not afraid?

27
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:44,029
Every step you take can make a change

28
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,448
The day has come

29
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,429
It all started in China's Qingqing City.

30
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,308
The news was that a glowing baby had
been born.

31
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,602
"Papa"
Ah... ah... ah!!

32
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,481
Since then, "paranormal things" were discovered
in various places.

33
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,275
Time passed by without us ever knowing
the reason.

34
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,279
At some point, "paranormal" became
normal...

35
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,949
...fiction became reality...

36
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,619
About 80% of the world's population...

37
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,623
...has became a society of superhumans
with these unique traits.

38
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,751
In a world full of chaos...

39
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,254
...the job everyone had only dreamed of...

40
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,340
...was now in the spotlight.

41
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,471
This job...

42
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,773
Oh, it's Death Arms!

43
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:56,027
Upholding justice with his bare arms,
The Punching Hero!

44
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,410
Hey, hey, this is dangerous, ya know.

45
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,536
Get back, get back!

46
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,749
Disaster relief specalist Backdraft is here!

47
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,129
Even so, being able to turn into a
monster is an awesome quirk!

48
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,547
What did he do?

49
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,633
Purse-snatching. After being cornered,
he started acting violently.

50
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,470
Purse-snatching using that quirk...

51
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,930
I'm sorry, the trains...

52
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,434
Eh? I'm not sure when I'll be at the
office, ah...

53
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:32,272
Yay! Do your best, Kamui!

54
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,445
Stay away from me!

55
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,990
Who's fighting?

56
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,163
Shinrin Kamui!

57
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,795
A young, talented artist who's popularity
is on the rize!

58
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,464
You ask but then explain, nii-chan.

59
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,590
You're an otaku, aren't you!

60
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,301
Uh, no. Hehehe...

61
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,987
Illegal use of abilities during rush
hour and robbery with injury...

62
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,241
The exact embodiment of evil.

63
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,744
Ah! It's coming!

64
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,080
One shot! Show us something flashy, Forest Man!

65
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,957
First strike...

66
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,834
...mandatory binding...

67
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,335
...chained to prison!

68
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,712
Canyon Canon!

69
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,346
Eh...

70
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:51,810
This is it! This is it!

71
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,936
Wow!

72
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:53,645
This is it! This is it!
This is it, this is it!

73
00:05:54,396 --> 00:06:00,068
I just made my debut today.
My name is Mt. Lady!

74
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,612
Glad to have a good rear-ationship with you!

75
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,244
Oh, the acknowledgement!

76
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,083
Along with the paranormal, came an explosive
increase in criminal activity.

77
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,670
While the government is hesitant
on changing the law...

78
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,297
...people with courage...

79
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,966
...started hero activities, just like in the comics.

80
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,596
Monitoring the paranormal and protecting
against evil...

81
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,889
Now, heros who have gained citizenship...

82
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,768
...are being made officials due to
pressure from public opinion.

83
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,522
They are rewarded based on their performance.

84
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,859
Money from the government, fame from
the people.

85
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,614
Gigantism?

86
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,074
It seems like she'll become popular,
and she has an awesome quirk, but...

87
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,660
Considering the damage it causes
to the city,

88
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,371
will her actions be limited?

89
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,457
Not if she can control her size...

90
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,209
Hey, hey. Are you taking notes to
become a hero?

91
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,753
Great! Do your best!

92
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,799
Eh... y- yes! I'll do my best!

93
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:08,800
"Midoriya Izuku: Origin"

94
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,892
Eh... You guys are already in your third year,

95
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,937
so it's time to think seriously about your future.

96
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,023
I'm going to give you print-outs
for career aspirations now...

97
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,156
Most of you want to take the
hero course, right?

98
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,783
Yes!

99
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,577
Ok, ok! Everyone, you all have good quirks.

100
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,122
But using your quirks isn't allowed at school.

101
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:40,627
Sensei. Don't lump me in with everyone else.

102
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:45,465
I'm not gonna be dragged down to the bottom
by these quirkless people.

103
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,142
"Bakugō Katsuki"

104
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,929
You've got to be kidding me, Katsuki!

105
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,639
Background characters are background
characters, so shut up!

106
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,100
Ah, surely Bakugō...

107
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,310
...is hoping to get into
U.A. High School.

108
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,312
Isn't U.A. the national school?

109
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,398
This year standard deviation score is 79!

110
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,149
The odds are always so wild, right?

111
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,860
And this is why all of you are
background characters.

112
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,447
I got an A on the mock exam.

113
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,242
I'm the only one on the same level as U.A.

114
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:17,831
I'll surpass that All Might,
and become the top hero--

115
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:22,002
My name will definently be engraved on
the list of high-income taxpayers!

116
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,046
Oh, I see. Midoriya also wanted to get
into U.A. High School.

117
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,844
Huh?

118
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,887
Midoriya? That's impossible!

119
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,765
You can't enter the hero industry
just by studying.

120
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,269
Th- That type of rule doesn't exist anymore.
There just isn't a need for it.

121
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,107
- Hey, Deku!
- Ah...

122
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:48,194
How the hell could someone who's a
quirkless loser like you

123
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,281
be on the same level as I am?!

124
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,825
W... you're wrong! Wait, Kat-chan!

125
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,870
I don't want to compete with you at all!

126
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,079
Really!

127
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,751
It's just... been my goal since I was little.

128
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,546
That and... I won't know unless I try.

129
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,549
What do you mean, "you won't know unless you try?"

130
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,760
Are you screwing with me?!

131
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,598
What the hell can you do?
You're quirkless!

132
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:22,935
"PM 0:02 the same city"

133
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,980
Ahh!

134
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,276
It's a robber! Somebody!

135
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,321
Catch me if you can!

136
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,533
Ah? There aren't any heros.

137
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,411
Usually someone shows up immediately.

138
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,122
- I guess they took advantage of the morning confusion.
- Hmm?

139
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,626
There are so many people who are
overwhelmed by their quirks.

140
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,420
It's hopeless.

141
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,632
"Hopeless?"

142
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,469
Why is that?

143
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,930
Hm? Oh!

144
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,934
I am here!

145
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,440
- Hey, let's go to karaoke.
- Sure, that's fine.

146
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,693
This morning's incident is at the top of news sites.

147
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,114
I have to hurry up and write that down
in my notebook!

148
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,490
Ah...

149
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,328
We're not done, Deku.

150
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,580
Katsuki? What is that?

151
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,502
Ah? "Hero Analysis for the Future?"

152
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,795
Seriously!

153
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,214
Midoriya!

154
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,216
All right, give it back!

155
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,554
You're terrible!

156
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:46,020
Most of the top heros have stories
from their days as a student.

157
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,233
I want to have the honor of being the
first and only student...

158
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,863
from this mediocre junior high school.

159
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,949
Well, I'm a perfectionist.

160
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,450
Picky.

161
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,912
- Wh...
- But anyways...

162
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,417
Don't apply to U.A., Nerd-kun.

163
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,800
At least say something back.

164
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,636
Don't say that! Poor little thing.

165
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,222
He still can't see reality.

166
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,310
Ah... if you want to have a quirk that badly,

167
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,145
there is an efficient way.

168
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,231
Believe that you'll have a quirk in
your next life,

169
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,525
and take a one-chance dive off the rooftop!

170
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:38,823
What?

171
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,502
Dumbass. If I did jump, that would've been
encouraged suicide.

172
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,921
Watch your mouth!

173
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,800
That's not food... idiots.

174
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:03,014
My notes... idiot.

175
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,436
Dumbass!

176
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,856
Okaa-san!

177
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,778
Okaa-san, the PC!

178
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,655
Again?

179
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,366
Hurry!

180
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,412
You alone have already increased the
view count by 10000, Izuku!

181
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,498
Okaa-san is too scared to watch.

182
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,210
This is an old video...

183
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:37,173
...from soon after a great disaster that
happened a while ago...

184
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,884
This is one of the hero's debut video.

185
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,222
Can you see it? He's already rescued 100 people!

186
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,350
Holy crap! It hasn't even been 10 minutes!

187
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,602
Holy crap!

188
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,154
He's laughing so hard!

189
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,497
It's all right now. Why, you say?

190
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,712
I am here!

191
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,929
He's so cool!

192
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,142
When I get my quirk, I want to
be this type of hero!

193
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,566
You should give up, all right?

194
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,115
That's... is something wrong?

195
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,826
The kindergarteners are already
showing signs.

196
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,453
It's just this kid...

197
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,373
Excuse me, ma'am, aren't you a 4th generation?

198
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,791
And your quirk?

199
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,752
Eh, of course!

200
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,963
I just attract small objects.

201
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,049
My husband breathes fire.

202
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,385
Normally, at 4 years old,

203
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,306
either one or both of these quirks would appear.

204
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,103
A long time ago, during the early ages of the
paranormal, some research was published

205
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:18,316
discussing whether or not there is a
joint in the pinky toe.

206
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,362
Humans don't need things we don't use...

207
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:26,074
Those without it are newer as a "type".

208
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,369
As you can see on this X-ray...

209
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,538
Izuku-kun has 2 joints.

210
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:39,253
It's rare in this generation, because
he's the type with no quirk.

211
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,597
Can you see it? He's already rescued 100 people!

212
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,600
Holy crap! It hasn't even been 10 minutes!

213
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,893
Holy crap!

214
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,563
He's laughing so hard!

215
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,608
It's all right now. Why, you say?

216
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,652
I am here!

217
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,239
Okaa-san...

218
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,911
No matter what type of trouble, he
helps them with a smile.

219
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,958
He's a super cool hero.

220
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,303
Can I become one too?

221
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,688
I'm sorry, Izuku... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

222
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,777
Ah, no.

223
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,946
No, okaa-san.

224
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,492
At that time, what I wanted you to say was...

225
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,543
I decided that on that day...

226
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,630
that I wasn't going to worry about
what other people said.

227
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,632
Look ahead, and keep going.

228
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,191
Ah... a villain?

229
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,778
You're an M-size camoflauge suit.

230
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,248
It's okay. I'm just taking over your body,
calm down.

231
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:44,504
It'll only be painful for about 45 seconds.

232
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,424
I can't... breathe...

233
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,386
I'm a fluid, so there's no way that you
can grab me, now is there?

234
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,557
Very helpful. You're my hero.

235
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:01,979
No way... I didn't think that that type of
guy would come to the city.

236
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,943
My body... doesn't have the power...

237
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,782
Am I... am I gonna die?

238
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,746
I'm gonna die... somebody...

239
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,459
Somebody... no!

240
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,838
Hm? Ohh!

241
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,717
It's all right now, shōnen.

242
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,976
I am here!

243
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:55,074
Texas Smash!

244
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,249
The wind pressure...

245
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,812
All... Mi...

246
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,443
Hey. Hey!

247
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,153
Hey... ah?

248
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,322
Thank goodness!

249
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,573
Ah!

250
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,036
I'm glad that you are doing well.

251
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,330
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,041
I got you involved in a villain extermination.

253
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,877
I don't usually make this type of mistake,

254
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,589
but I just got excited because I was off-duty
and in an unfamiliar place.

255
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,216
Ahahahaha!

256
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,968
- Ah...
- But...

257
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,262
...thanks to you...

258
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,140
I have captured him safely!

259
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:07,021
Number 1 hero All Might...

260
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,067
It's... it's really him! He looks...

261
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,654
completely different in person!

262
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,323
I see, ah! Autograph...

263
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,575
Autograph, autograph... Uh... Ah!

264
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,951
My notebook!

265
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,621
He signed it!

266
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,582
Wow! Tha... thank you!

267
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,585
I'll treasure it forever!

268
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,586
Okay!

269
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,340
Well then, I'm gonna deliver this
guy to the police.

270
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,468
See you again through the LCD screen!

271
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,346
Eh... that's... already?

272
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,974
Pros are always battling against either
enemies or time.

273
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:50,147
Wait... I still... wanted to ask you...

274
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,609
In the future...

275
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,031
Please continue to support me!

276
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:00,491
Eh...

277
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,495
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

278
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,373
Let go! You're too enthusiastic!

279
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:11,210
If I let go now, I'll d-die!

280
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,878
Oh, for sure.

281
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,423
I-I-I-I want...

282
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,466
t-to a-ask you d-directly...

283
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,052
I... t-to you...

284
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,512
Okay, okay!

285
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,515
I understand. Now close your
eyes and mouth!

286
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,570
Shit...

287
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,293
Th... that was scary.

288
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,170
Good grief...

289
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,964
If you talk to the people downstairs,
they'll drop you off.

290
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,050
I really don't have time, so this is it.

291
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,595
Wait! Ah...

292
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,473
- No! I don't have time!
- But!

293
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,516
You should give up, all right?

294
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,065
- I'm sorry, Izuku... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

295
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:20,237
- What the hell can you do? You're quirkless!

296
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,996
That may be true...

297
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,626
But, even so...

298
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,961
I...

299
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,722
Is it possible to become a hero without
a quirk?

300
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,186
Can someone without a quirk

301
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,939
become a hero like you?

302
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:10,746
Meeting All Might was a miracle...

303
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,458
It would change my destiny dramatically.

304
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,336
At the time...

305
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,214
I hadn't even imagined it.

306
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,690
In the world surrounding me and my
uninspired self

307
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,009
Even if I draw it or grasp it, it's
still far away

308
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:37,168
Woah-oh

309
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:47,705
I woke up from a dream where no matter how
close I got, it kept going further away

310
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:57,021
The sunrise starts to shine over the
subdued town

311
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:07,274
I'm shaking, searching for the meaning of
my existence in the dark

312
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:12,652
In the world surrounding me and my
uninspired self

313
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:17,114
Even if I draw it or grasp it, it's
still far away

314
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:22,346
What do I have to give up in order
to reach it

315
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:27,331
Because no matter how many times I scream

316
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:31,793
I am who I am

317
00:23:31,794 --> 00:23:37,039
Whether it's fictional or real

318
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,580
I know I can get through it

319
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:44,480
It's okay to fall

320
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:46,600
It's okay to cry

321
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,865
Because someday all of that

322
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:51,102
Will become a flower

323
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,143
In the preview of the next episode...

324
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,811
I am here!

325
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,981
What? The villain that was supposed to have
been captured has escaped?

326
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,485
It's taken a shōnen hostage and is running
wildly around the city?

327
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,363
But my time limit... is running out!

328
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,283
Ugh... you're pathetic, All Might!

329
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,661
Isn't there some hero out there?

330
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,538
Next time: "Hero Requirements"!

331
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,957
Pros always risk their lives!

332
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,584
Above and beyond,

333
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,336
Plus Ultra!
