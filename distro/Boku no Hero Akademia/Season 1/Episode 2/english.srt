1
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,098
It's all right now. Why, you say?

2
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,271
I am here!

3
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,489
He's so cool!

4
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,743
When I get my quirk, I want to
be like this!

5
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,246
You should give up, all right?

6
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,794
Even if that's the case...

7
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,673
How the hell could someone who's a
quirkless loser like you

8
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,634
be on the same level as I am?

9
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,763
What the hell can you do?!

10
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,976
Even if that's how everyone felt...

11
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:03,522
I'm sorry, Izuku! I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

12
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,486
Ah, no.

13
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,613
No, okaa-san.

14
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,825
I...

15
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,786
Even so, I...

16
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,833
Is it possible to become a hero without
a quirk?

17
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,297
Can someone without a quirk

18
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,049
become a hero like you?

19
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,520
Without a...

20
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,115
Oh no...

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,160
Holy shit, damn it!

22
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,204
Because I'm quirkless,

23
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,458
though it may not be because of that, but...

24
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,169
I've been made fun of for a while...

25
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,255
So, I don't know, but...

26
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,384
I think saving people is really cool.

27
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,388
Saving people with a fearless smile...

28
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:23,685
I also, want to become the best hero like you!

29
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,523
Oh...

30
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:42,261
At 5 am I held my breath as the silence sunk in

31
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,460
Biting my nails on the fire escape,
what will tomorrow bring?

32
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:50,080
The day has come

33
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:05,487
The never-ending night and the never-ending rain

34
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:09,311
Are all part of this worthless world

35
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:10,605
"Become a hero too! - Sidekick Recruitment"
Are all part of this worthless world

36
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:15,729
Isn't it a little bit off, my feet are
caught up in a slumber

37
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,999
I'm not blaming you

38
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:25,327
Playing alone in your fantasies

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:33,977
Are you even ashamed of what you imagine there?

40
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:41,527
A labyrinth, getting tangled inside a labyrinth,
will you still say that you'll go

41
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:46,825
The sound of the starting bell played by
a little traveler

42
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,449
Where am I headed? Don't know, don't know

43
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,908
Are you really not afraid?

44
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:55,873
Every step you take can make a change

45
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:59,717
The day has come

46
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,923
Where am I?

47
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,633
What the heck?

48
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,343
Texas...

49
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:24,014
- ...Smash!
- Oh right, that bastard.

50
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,852
That bastard, if he hadn't been there...

51
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,061
Katsuki.

52
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,814
Weren't you and Midoriya friends as kids?

53
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,650
You kinda overdid it today.

54
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,987
It's his fault for being in my way.

55
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,073
Hey, don't get irritated about it.

56
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:48,121
It's just... been my goal since I was little.

57
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,748
That and...

58
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,375
I won't know unless I try.

59
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,506
He's just an idiot holding onto his
childhood dreams.

60
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,091
It makes me angry just watching him!

61
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,181
Well, let's go freshen up at the arcade!
Are you coming too, Katsuki?

62
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,099
Hm... yeah.

63
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,103
Let's go to the station. There are
lots of suckers there.

64
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,897
You're bad.

65
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,025
Ah? If I get caught, it'll affect
my school records!

66
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,195
Ah? Hey, hey!

67
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:25,826
Hiding such a good quirk!

68
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,756
You deflated!

69
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,510
Eh? Until now.... eh?!

70
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,512
A... a fake?

71
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,013
Skinny!

72
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,642
I am All Might!

73
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,145
No way!

74
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:59,109
There are guys at the pool who are
constantly flexing their abs...

75
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,068
It's that.

76
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,153
No way!

77
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,032
No... no way!

78
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,994
All Might is fearless...

79
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,998
Always helping with the best smile...

80
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:17,210
Ah... a fearless smile.

81
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,425
Because you've seen me, shōnen,

82
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,052
don't make the mistake of posting this
on the internet.

83
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,890
Five years ago,

84
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,143
I got this injury from an enemy attack.

85
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,897
Respitory system partially destroyed,
stomach completely removed...

86
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:42,152
The repeated surgeries and their side effects
have weakened me.

87
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,324
My time limit for hero activities is now...

88
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,826
About 3 hours per day.

89
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,829
That's...

90
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,205
Five years ago...

91
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,583
When you fought Toxic Chainsaw?

92
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,627
You're familar with it.

93
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,505
But that kind of thug won't stop me.

94
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,509
This hasn't gone public yet...

95
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,804
Because I asked them not to publicize it.

96
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:16,061
The symbol of peace that saves with a smile...

97
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,813
...must never give in to evil!

98
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,902
I laugh to distract myself from the
pressures of being a hero...

99
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:29,074
And from the fear that rises inside of me.

100
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,996
Pros always risk their lives!

101
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,874
To become a hero without a "superpower..."

102
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,127
...I can't say that it's possible.

103
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,512
If you want to help people...

104
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,847
you can also be a police officer.

105
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,850
They're often the butt of jokes as
the "villain receptionists..."

106
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,394
but that's also a good job.

107
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,025
It's not bad to dream...

108
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:09,656
But you also have to face reality, shōnen.

109
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,123
Now, hurry up with this guy...

110
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,349
No way...

111
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,774
It's a villain! Which hero's on scene?

112
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,363
To become a hero without a "superpower..."

113
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,159
...I can't say that it's possible.

114
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,734
He kidnapped a child!

115
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,904
That's playing dirty!

116
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,453
What is all this?

117
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,330
I can't grab it!

118
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,456
No!

119
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,667
Death Arms!

120
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,628
Crap!

121
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,007
Hey, stay away from me!

122
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,014
I won't let a sewer man like you

123
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,102
swallow me up!

124
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,437
You little...

125
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:14,197
Amazing power! This is great, isn't it!

126
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,242
With this quirk,

127
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,536
I can finally get revenge on this kid!

128
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,288
Woah, what is that?

129
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,332
Maybe he's a big-time villain.

130
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,667
She's here!

131
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,211
Rookie Hero Mt. Lady!

132
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,630
Ah, woah, woah!

133
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,134
I need at least 2 lanes to do this.

134
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,683
Explosions are my weakness.

135
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,810
I let someone else handle this.

136
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,311
Ah, thank you.

137
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,065
My hands are full fighting the fire.

138
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,273
Is the fire truck here yet?

139
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,275
What's the situation?

140
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,485
It's sticky, I can't grab it,

141
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,155
And the kid with the good quirk is
struggling and resisting.

142
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,157
Thanks to that it's a minefield.

143
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,617
A triple-threat situation.

144
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,291
Crap!

145
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,335
It's no good! Right now,

146
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,712
nobody here can do this!

147
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,840
We'll just have to wait for someone
with a helpful qurik to come!

148
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,968
Until then, let's limit the damage.

149
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,470
Someone will come soon!

150
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,516
I feel bad for that kid, but he'll have to
endure it just a little bit longer.

151
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,851
Damn it!

152
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,272
If only I had the power to blow
him away...

153
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,150
Hey, doesn't something feel off?

154
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,818
Try your best, heros!

155
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,535
At that time...

156
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,789
I was distracted by my activity timer...

157
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:50,293
I made this type of mistake while
admonishing my fan...

158
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,003
Pathetic...

159
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,965
I'm pathetic!

160
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,017
- Even in his 3rd year of junior high...

161
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,520
- He still... can't see reality.

162
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:13,316
- It's time to think seriously about
your future.

163
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,694
- But you have to face reality.

164
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,450
Even a top Pro said it.

165
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,955
Don't cry! You know this is the reality!

166
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,125
You knew it, and that's why you
tried so hard.

167
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,379
Telling yourself you couldn't see it.

168
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,761
This is the explosion from earlier...

169
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:47,100
Hey, hey...
Did I come here out of habit?

170
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,478
Stop!

171
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,355
It'll just make me feel empty.

172
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,067
Why is he here?

173
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,487
He escaped from All Might?

174
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,951
He dropped it?

175
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,370
If he did...

176
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,041
It's my...

177
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:11,332
fault.

178
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,584
Why are the heros just standing here?

179
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,253
They can't do anything.

180
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,296
A junior high student was captured.

181
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,381
They've been like that the entire time.

182
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,215
Eh?

183
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,620
Been captured...

184
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,136
the entire time?

185
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,139
And they're able to endure that type of pain?

186
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,018
I thought I'd die within seconds.

187
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,520
Unbelievable...

188
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,063
That villain...

189
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,107
Isn't that the one All Might was
chasing earlier?

190
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,069
All Might? No way! He's here?

191
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,155
I saw him a while ago.

192
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,197
For real?

193
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,159
So then, what is All Might doing?

194
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,961
It's all my fault he can't move...

195
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,006
Pathetic.

196
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,592
Nobody can grab that guy.

197
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,345
We'll just have to wait for a hero with
a helpfull quirk.

198
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,724
Pathetic...

199
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:14,228
Please do your best... I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...

200
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,481
Pathetic!

201
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,192
Help will be here soon!

202
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,402
Pathetic!

203
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:25,656
Somebody, a hero will come...

204
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,055
Dumbass!

205
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,349
Stop! Stop!

206
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,810
That brat...

207
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:54,769
Deku?

208
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,979
Why did I go?

209
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,899
Why did I do it? Why?

210
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,943
Explode and die!

211
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,280
What should I do? What should I do at
a time like this?

212
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,033
Page 25!

213
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,004
Kat-chan!

214
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,132
Why you?!

215
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,927
I don't know why, but my legs just
moved on their own.

216
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,515
I think there are many different reasons

217
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,892
- You should give up, all right?
- My... fault.

218
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,020
- ...be on the same level as me?!
- He's a super cool hero!

219
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:38,813
Kat-chan!

220
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,812
- ...face reality...
- It's been my goal since...

221
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,606
- I'll try my best!

222
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,316
- ...he helps them with a smile...

223
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,486
- But, at that time...

224
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:51,284
You looked like you needed help.

225
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,748
Stop it!

226
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,585
Pathetic...

227
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,588
I'm pathetic!

228
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,424
Just a little bit longer...

229
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,342
Get out of the way!

230
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,095
This would be a pointless death! Are you
trying to commit suicide?

231
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,400
I'm really pathetic...

232
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,029
All Might...

233
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,115
I admonish you...

234
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,327
...yet I don't even try to do
my part!

235
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:42,418
Pros always risk their lives!

236
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,171
All Might!

237
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,284
Detroit...

238
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:49,091
Smash!

239
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,253
Oh... rain?

240
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,881
- No way! Was the wind pressure right now?

241
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,008
- There was an updraft...

242
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,307
Did he make clouds?

243
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,815
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

244
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,319
He changed the weather with only his right hand!

245
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,821
Awesome!

246
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,031
So this is All Might!

247
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:11,882
After that, the heros collected the scattered goop

248
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,386
and safely took it to the police.

249
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:19,974
Good grief!

250
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,601
That was too much!

251
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,979
You didn't have to take any risks.

252
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,025
The heros scolded me...

253
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,694
On the contrary, Kat-chan was praised.

254
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,905
Amazing toughness! And that quirk!

255
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,200
When you become a pro, come to
our company!

256
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,203
You'd make an excellent sidekick!

257
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,891
I wanted to apologize to All Might, but...

258
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,392
he was being interviewed.

259
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,938
When I get back, I'll try sending him
a message on his homepage.

260
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,066
Deku!

261
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,360
Kat-chan...

262
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:21,619
I didn't ask for your help...

263
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,287
And you didn't even save me!

264
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,707
I could've done it myself.

265
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,710
Don't look down on me, you quirkless loser.

266
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,796
You think you did me a favor?

267
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,173
Don't look down on me.

268
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,884
Damn nerd!

269
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,762
Toughness...

270
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,809
Kat-chan is right.

271
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:48,187
I didn't acomplish or change anything.

272
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,648
But, I'm happy.

273
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,693
Now I can have a future that suits me...

274
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,153
I have come!

275
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,239
A... All Might?

276
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,407
Why are you here?

277
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,701
Weren't you surrounded by reporters?

278
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,705
Getting away from them is very easy.

279
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,081
Why?

280
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,583
Because I'm All Migh-

281
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,177
Shōnen, I came here to thank you and
correct myself...

282
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,513
And to make a suggestion.

283
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,806
Eh?

284
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,891
Without you...

285
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,602
If I hadn't heard your story...

286
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,523
...I would've become a fake who's just
all talk and no show. Thanks.

287
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,110
No, it was my fault in the first place.

288
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:42,116
I got in the way of your work and talked big,
despite the fact I'm quirkless.

289
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,200
Yes...

290
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:49,123
Because you, a timid, quirkless person unlike
anybody else in that situation...

291
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,666
is what moved me.

292
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,965
Top heros have stories from their days
as a student.

293
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,385
Many of their stories end with,

294
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:08,184
"My body started moving before I could
even think about it."

295
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,145
Ah...

296
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,736
For whatever reason,

297
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,822
I thought of my mom's words.

298
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,325
- I'm sorry, Izuku...

299
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,953
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

300
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,292
It was the same for you too, wasn't it?

301
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,129
Yeah!

302
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,925
- No, okaa-san.

303
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,263
At that time, what I wanted you to say was...

304
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,018
The words I wanted you to say were...

305
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,901
You can become a hero.

306
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,371
Fiction became reality.

307
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,835
I forgot to tell you...

308
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,458
But this is...

309
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:20,881
The story of how I became the
greatest hero.

310
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,690
In the world surrounding me and my
uninspired self

311
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,009
Even if I draw it or grasp it, it's
still far away

312
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:37,168
Woah-oh

313
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:47,705
I woke up from a dream where no matter how
close I got, it kept going further away

314
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:57,021
The sunrise starts to shine over the
subdued town

315
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:07,274
I'm shaking, searching for the meaning of
my existence in the dark

316
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:12,652
In the world surrounding me and my
uninspired self

317
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:17,114
Even if I draw it or grasp it, it's
still far away

318
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:22,346
What do I have to give up in order
to reach it

319
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:27,331
Because no matter how many times I scream

320
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:31,793
I am who I am

321
00:23:31,794 --> 00:23:37,039
Whether it's fictional or real

322
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,580
I know I can get through it

323
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:44,480
It's okay to fall

324
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:46,600
It's okay to cry

325
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,865
Because someday all of that

326
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:51,102
Will become a flower

327
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,102
Shōnen, you are worthy

328
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,812
of inheriting my power!

329
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,939
Inheriting your power?

330
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:05,402
Accept it! My quirk is "One For All."

331
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,072
With this, I can become a hero too?

332
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,617
It's impossible, your body can't keep up with it.

333
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,035
Eh?

334
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,162
Next time: "Roaring Muscles!"

335
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,916
Midoriya-shōnen is gonna become ripped!

336
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,209
Above and beyond,

337
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,836
Plus Ultra!
